ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_01_0,"Commander, I'm glad you're here. \nWe have a situation."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_01_1,Interdimensional signatures are popping up all over New York City.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_01_2,"As commander of S.T.R.I.K.E., interdimensional threats are your jurisdiction. "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_01_3,I've taken the liberty of assigning you two agents.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_02_0,No one knows New York City like Spider-Man. He should come in handy.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_03_0,I've also transferred my top medic to S.T.R.I.K.E. for additional support.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_04_0,Looks like Kingpin is helping smuggle interdimensional <color=#fff568>ORBS</color> into the city.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_00_04_1,We should start by intercepting his shipment.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_01_01_0,Hey Commander! We intercepted Kingpin's guys transporting the interdimensional glowing things.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_01_01_1,"But Kingpin's mercs won't hand the orbs over. I even said ""please!"""
ID_DIALOG_NUE_01_02_0,Use Spider-Man's <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color>.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_01_03_0,Use the S.H.I.E.L.D. Medic's <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> to heal your squad.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_01_04_0,Use Spider-Man's <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> to defeat the remaining mercenaries.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_01_05_0,Good work. Now bring those <color=#fff568>POWER CORES</color> back to base. \nWe can use them to open one of the orbs your team recovered.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_01_0,Maybe if we use our remaining <color=#fff568>POWER CORES</color> we can open one of the <color=#fff568>ORBS</color>...
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_02_0,Select the <color=#fff568>PREMIUM ORB</color> to enter the <color=#fff568>ORB CHAMBER</color>.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_03_0,Use the <color=#fff568>POWER CORES</color> to open the <color=#fff568>ORB</color> you recovered.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_04_0,"Luke Cage was inside that <color=#fff568>ORB</color>? \nHe does NOT look happy about that. "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_05_0,Sweet Christmas! \nThanks for getting me out of that thing.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_05_1,Kingpin's abducting heroes around the city. He's using tech way out of his league.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_05_2,"Whatever Kingpin is up to, it needs to be stopped. Count me in. "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_06_0,Kingpin's our target. Your goals are tracked in <color=#fff568>DAILY OBJECTIVES</color>.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_02_07_0,We've tracked Kingpin's operation to the warehouse district. Move out.

ID_DIALOG_NUE_BUFF_TAUNT1_0,Applying a <color=#fff568>TAUNT</color> effect forces enemies to target that unit.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_03_01_0,You recovered a <color=#fff568>TRAINING MODULE</color>. \nLet's send Spider-Man through <color=#fff568>TRAINING</color>.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_03_02_0,"To send a S.T.R.I.K.E. character through <color=#fff568>TRAINING</color>, select your <color=#fff568>ROSTER</color>..."

ID_DIALOG_NUE_FIRSTTIME_EVENT_CHALLENGE_02_1,"As your <color=#fff568>COMMANDER LEVEL</color> increases, more difficult <color=#fff568>CHALLENGES</color> will appear with greater rewards."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_FIRSTTIME_GEAR_01_0,"Looks like Kingpin was also stealing <color=#fff568>S.T.R.I.K.E. GEAR</color>. "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_FIRSTTIME_GEAR_02_0,Let's put that <color=#fff568>GEAR</color> to good use. \n Spider-Man could use some new web shooters.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_FIRSTTIME_GEAR_03_0,<color=#fff568>GEAR</color> empowers and upgrades your agents.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_FIRSTTIME_GEAR_03_1,Increase the <color=#fff568>GEAR TIER</color> by completing a set of six <color=#fff568>GEAR</color> pieces and unlock new abilities.

ID_DIALOG_NUE_FIRSTTIME_EVENTS_02_0,Here you will find <color=#fff568>SPECIAL EVENTS</color> with unique and valuable rewards.

ID_DIALOG_NUE_SIM_01_0,"Commander, you have been making excellent progress. Are you aware we can simulate your past missions?"
ID_DIALOG_NUE_SIM_01_1,"After completing a <color=#fff568>MISSION</color> with <color=#fff568>3 MEDALS</color>, you can <color=#fff568>AUTO WIN</color> the battle instantly."

ID_DIALOG_NUE_SIM_02_0,"Give it a try, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_SIM_03_0,You can <color=#fff568>AUTO WIN</color> a mission up to ten times at once. Some missions can only <color=#fff568>AUTO WIN</color> a limited number of times per day.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_COMMANDER_01_0,"Commander, I'm giving you access to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s internal communication network."

ID_DIALOG_NUE_COMMANDER_02_0,"In order to grant you access, you will need to register a <color=#fff568>CODE NAME</color>."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_COMMANDER_03_0,"What will your <color=#fff568>CODE NAME</color> be, Commander? "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_LOSS_01_0,"You can't win every engagement, Commander. Return to base and <color=#fff568>TRAIN</color> your recruits.  "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_LOSS_02_0,"<color=#fff568>TRAIN</color> and equip <color=#fff568>GEAR</color> to prepare for the next mission. Take your time. Good luck, Commander"

ID_DIALOG_NUE_RAIDS_01_0,"Commander, we're receiving reports that Ultimus has strongholds all over the multiverse."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_RAIDS_02_0,You will need to work together with your <color=#fff568>ALLIANCE</color> in an <color=#fff568>ALLIANCE RAID</color> to clear them out.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_RAIDS_03_0,"To start an <color=#fff568>ALLIANCE RAID</color>, your <color=#fff568>ALLIANCE</color> will need to generate <color=#fff568>RAID KEYS</color>."

ID_DIALOG_NUE_RAIDS_04_3,"The more you contribute to the success of the <color=#fff568>ALLIANCE RAID</color>, the better your <color=#fff568>REWARDS</color> when the <color=#fff568>ALLIANCE RAID</color> is finished."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_SYNERGY_01_0,You have a character with <color=#fff568>TRAIT SYNERGIES</color>. Tap the <color=#fff568>ICON</color> to see what they are.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_UNDERWORLD_1_INTRO_0,The Kree are abducting my associates and converting them to their cause.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_UNDERWORLD_1_INTRO_1,I'm sure whoever rescued would be willing to join S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_START_0,We're getting reports of Elektra running rampant in Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_START_1,"Daredevil, work with the Commander on this."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_START_2,I'll take a team and track her down.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_0,"Elektra, the senseless killing has to stop."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_1,"Murdock, you fool. It's not me. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_2,"Someone is committing crimes in this city while wearing my face. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_3,"I was closing in on the imposter when you jumped me. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_4,"That explains a lot. We have a common enemy. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_5,"If we help you with the imposter, will you help us stop the one she works for?"
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_6,Gladly.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_2_START_0,The impostor is headed this way... and it looks like she is not alone.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_2_START_1,There are a lot of imposters floating around these days.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_START_0,The likeness is uncanny. What sort of magic is this?
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_START_1,No magic. I am YOU. Just empowered by my newfound faith... and deadlier.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_START_2,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_0,The imposter was NOT my equal in strength and skill.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_1,Fury says these corrupted versions of us are weaker than the ones from our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_2,So we work for Nick Fury now?
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_3,"Working together is the only chance we have of defeating this threat. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_4,"Very well. But don't expect me to wear a badge. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_5,Wasn't even going to suggest it.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_0,The Elektra imposter was working to corrupt the Hand Ninja Clan to the invaders' side.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_1,"If they take control of the Hand, they will have an army of ninjas at their side."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_2,Nobu is the Hand's leader. That's who they will try to replace.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_3,Then we have to get to him before they do.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_END_0,Our only chance is getting to Nobu before they replace him with a corrupted version.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_END_1,Then follow me.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_0,"You enter my domain unannounced, ninja."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_1,"No time for formalities, Nobu. You are in danger. Imposters are attempting to--"
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_2,"If you are referring to our new friends, the Kree, then I believe you are too late."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_3,They've already corrupted you. Then we do this the hard way.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_END_0,Nobu has been corrupted. We have to take out the entire clan.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_END_1,Better get to work.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_START_0,"The Immortal Iron Fist, you are sworn enemy to the Hand. Now you fight with them?"
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_START_1,"The Hand, the Fist, and the Devil fight for a new leader now."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_START_2,Then you must be put down as well.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_END_0,"There is someone else guiding the Hand. Someone pulling Nobu's strings. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_END_1,Our true enemy has yet to reveal himself.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_0,I sensed that a corrupted version of myself might be behind this.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_1,Deep down you know this feels right. You just always let your conscience get in the way.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_2,You know I won't let you get away with this.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_3,I already have. The New York Hand belongs to me now. And I answer to another.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_0,I doubt that is the last we will see of your corrupted version.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_1,"Probably. And as long as a corrupted Daredevil rules the Hand, he runs New York City."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_2,We have to find a way to regain control of the Hand.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_3,I think I have an idea...
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_0,We're getting reports of a bank robbery in Midtown. Take a team and check it out.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_1,A bank robbery? Really? While there's an interdimensional alien invasion going on?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_2,Crossbones is involved. He was one of the first Hydra agents to work for the invaders.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_3,It's important.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_0,Aren't you supposed to be plotting world domination instead of robbing banks?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_1,"I don't work for our invaders anymore. They double-crossed me. All of Hydra, for that matter."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_2,Their brainwashing commando squad should be showing up to kidnap me any minute now.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_3,Here's the deal: I'll join S.T.R.I.K.E. and help you fight against them if you protect me from their commando squad.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_4,Give me one good reason why I should trust a backstabbing Hydra mercenary like you?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_5,"Only one? For starters, I know a lot about your enemy's operation. Codes, procedures, transport sites..."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_6,And you know I pack a mean punch.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_7,Let's get you some security clearance.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_START_0,"Okay, I joined your S.T.R.I.K.E. Force. Now you guys have to protect me from this brainwashing kidnap squad."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_START_1,"A deal is a deal. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_0,Alright. You're safe. Now tell us everything you know about the invaders.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_1,Give me a second... I gotta get used to the idea of being a good guy.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_2,You are NOT a good guy. You're just the lesser of two evils.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_3,Wow. You really know how to make a guy feel special.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_0,The invaders' first step is to ally with evil organizations and get them to abduct heroes.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_1,They trap the heroes in those orbs and send them through the portals for corruption.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_2,"Let me guess: Then they double-cross the bad guys and convert them, too."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_3,"Yeah. They left that part out of the initial sales pitch. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_4,"So now we're going to intercept a shipment of orbs as payback. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_0,Now we just follow the trail back to the warehouse where they are sending these orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_1,"You're actually enjoying this, aren't you?"
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_2,Screwing over the guys who promised me the world and then tried to brainwash me?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_3,Yeah. I'm enjoying this.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_START_0,This is one of the black sites for Ultimus's kidnappers. Looks like they didn't relocate.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_START_1,Perimeter breach! Alert!
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_START_2,Payback time.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_END_0,"Inside is usually where they keep the portal that they send the orbs through. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_END_1,And on the other side is where they put them through the Conversion Process?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_END_2,Yep. And what comes back is completely loyal to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_0,"Crossbones. They told me you had tried to run. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_1,Thanks for saving me the trouble of having to pursue you.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_2,"That's me. Mister Helpful. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_3,"While I'm here, mind if we completely destroy your operation?"
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_0,"Damn, that felt good. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_1,"Korath is always running his mouth about ""pursuing this"" and ""pursuing that."""
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_2,Now the only thing he is pursuing is my fist!
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_3,That makes no sense.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_4,Doesn't matter. Still felt good.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_0,Only thing left to do is get in there and smash the portal.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_1,Then Ultimus can't receive captured heroes in orbs and convert them.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_2,Exactly.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_3,"Except for the dozens of other portals he's set up around the world. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_4,"Well, at least it's a start."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_5,"You really are a ""glass half full"" sort of girl."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_NEBULA_0,"You didn't really think you could just march in here and destroy our portal, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_NEBULA_1,Of course not. We planned on beating you up first.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_0,"Heads up, Latex. A corrupted version of Red Skull will be guarding the portal."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_1,The Head of Hydra. Is that going to be a problem for you?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_2,Not at all. I've thought of punching the REAL Red Skull in the face many times.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_3,Beating up an Ultimus-controlled puppet version is close enough.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_4,I'm starting to enjoy working with you.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_0,Crossbones. You have betrayed Hydra and Ultimus for the last time.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_1,Fine by me. Wasn't really planning on betraying you guys TWICE.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_2,You shall pay for your betrayal.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_3,"You got it all wrong, Red Cheeks. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_4,It's YOU who's going to pay. With my FIST!
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_5,You really have to work on your comebacks.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_END_0,"Smell that, Red? Sweet revenge. There's nothing like it."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_END_1,"Can you even smell through that mask? "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_END_2,Don't spoil the moment.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Agents of S.T.R.I.K.E., it looks like we have another problem brewing in New York."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,"New York. You mean ""The City That Never Sleeps Because It's Always Under Attack?"""
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,"We're already following the trail of destruction. Thanos has arrived, but what does he want? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,"I believe he sees Ultimus as a rival and seeks to destroy him. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_4,Thanos versus Ultimus? We should just let them fight it out.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_5,"It's true that Thanos is one of the few beings who rivals Ultimus in power. However, the collateral damage would be devastating. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_6,"We'll have to deploy a team to lure Thanos out of the city. Parker, do you copy?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_7,"Special Agent Peter Parker reporting from the scene, sir! I'll try to get his attention."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_8,"Deploy a team to slow down Thanos, or at least to lure him out of the city. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_0,"Hey Purple Reign, could I get you to take this thing outside? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_1,"And by outside, I mean, not on my home planet?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_2,"Be gone, insolent child. I will not yield until Ultimus lies broken before me. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_3,"Commander, I don't think he's interested in a team-up. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_MID_0,Ultimus! Stop hiding behind these pathetic mortals. Face me!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_MID_1,"Mad Titan, I welcome the challenge."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_END_0,"Thanos, without your precious Infinity Stones, you are no match for me. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_END_1,You need a lesson in humility. Perhaps if I exile you to another dimension you will come to know your true station in the grand order.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,"I think Thanos is waking up. Don't be mad, big guy, but I have some not-great news for you..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,"We've been captured by Ultimus, sent to another dimension, and trapped in a Kree Prison ship with Star-Lord and Gamora. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,"A temporary setback. If Ultimus thinks this paltry vessel can hold Thanos, he is sorely mistaken."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,"Gamora, does this egomaniac always refer to himself in the third person? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,"You do that, too. Constantly."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_START_0,"Once I free myself from this ship, I will locate the Reality Stone and use it to return to our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_START_1,"Thanos, we're trapped here together. For now, we're your only allies. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_START_2,So it seems. Let us see how well you were trained in THIS dimension.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_END_0,"Excellent, we have taken control of the ship."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_END_1,"Yeah, but you damaged the primary flight controls!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_END_2,"Hold on, everyone! I'll try to make this landing a little less crashy!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,"Any landing you can walk away from, right? So, what's the next step to getting us back to our dimension, Captain Titanic?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,"The Infinity Stones. If I can find the Reality Stone in this dimension, I can use it to open a gateway. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,"I know the unique quantum wave signature of the stone. Find me a multiphasic tetraplex scanner. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,"Oh, that's all? A powerful scanner like that is incredibly rare. There's only one in this quadrant. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,"Sounds like we need a new ship. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_5,"I saw a starport in that direction before we crashed. Let's take out the guards and find a ship. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_START_0,"There's the starport. There's a suitable ship on the launch pad. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_START_1,Spidey-Sense tingling. The guards have spotted us!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_MID_0,"You ain't gettin' anywhere near that spaceship, Bub! "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_MID_1,Ultimus wants your heads.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_0,"They've raised the alarm. We will crush their guards and see them driven before us. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_1," ...Wow. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_2,"Peter, can you create a diversion so we can get inside?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_3,"You know it! See you on the flipside. And Gamora... be careful. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Star-Lord drew off most of the patrols, but we'll still have to get past the perimeter guards. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,"Let them come. I will leave their broken bodies behind as a message to Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_START_0,You think you can take on ALL of us? Who do you think you are!?
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_START_1,"I am Thanos, the Last Titan... And this day will be your last. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_END_0,"Your cruelty serves you well, as ever. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_END_1,"My cruelty forged your strength. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_END_2,"I was trained by the Thanos of this dimension, not by you. Ultimus vanquished him long ago. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,"Hey corrupted Yondu and corrupted... uh... me... Can we maybe just borrow your ship? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,"Boy, you got some stones on you. Ain't nobody getting on my ship without my say-so. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,"How about a showdown? You win, you get the ship. We win, we get Thanos in chains."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,I can take you both alone.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_4,"That wouldn't be sporting, would it? Choose a partner."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_START_0,"Alright, kiddo, let's show 'em what we're made of."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_START_1,"You got it, pops."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_FAIL_0,Some tough guy you turned out to be.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_END_0,"Pitiful whelps. They never seem to learn. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_END_1,Hey! I resemble that remark.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,Sensors are detecting the multiphasic scanner on the world below. Energy readings are off the charts.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,"I need access to the central control capsule if I am to locate the Reality Stone. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,"I'll set us down out of range of their guns. I don't feel like crashing again. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_3,"Do as you must, fragile human."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_END_0,"This planet's defenses are pathetic. Ultimus shows no end of hubris. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_END_1,"The scanner isn't far from here. It will be more heavily guarded.  "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_07_START_0,"Loki, look at these fools. They think they can harbor a fugitive without retribution. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_07_START_1,"Well, at the very least, they ought to provide us with some degree of entertainment."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_07_END_0,"There was a time when it meant something to be a god. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_0,"At last, the central controls. Step aside, tin toy, or be crushed beneath my boot. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_1,"Don't think so, Thanos. I'm willing to sacrifice everything for Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_2,"Stark, seriously, don't mess with this guy. He has a flying golden throne. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_3,Yeah? So does M.O.D.O.K.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_4,Ouch!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_END_0,At last. We shall now return home and exact our revenge on the usurper.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_0,Not one step further.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_1,"Nebula, you disappoint me in every dimension, it seems. You would serve that false idol and fight with these peons?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_2,"I learned the power of Ultimus when he destroyed the Thanos of this dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_3,"And now I will see you defeated yet again... ""Father."""
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_4,"So, I am forced to break you once more. Such a shame. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_START_0,All that's left is to enter the control capsule and locate the Reality Stone. Then we return to the Nexus dimension.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_START_1,I will focus the array while Thanos searches for the Reality Stone's signature.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_1_0,"The control capsule is online. I can already feel the energy coursing through me.  "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_2_0,"I'm reaching out, but I cannot feel the Reality Stone. More power!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_3_0,"The power... I can feel it... flowing through me... my strength, it... wait... NO..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_3_1,Something is wrong. Let me try to regain control.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_3_2,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_FAIL_0,We've lost our Operator. We need to regroup.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_0,AGH!!!  GRAAAH!!!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_1,No! The system shut me out!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_2,Uh... what just happened?
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_3,Thanos is mine.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_0,"Thanos, you have made this all too easy. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_1,"I knew you would be drawn to the promise of power. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_2,It was the only way I could lure an Eternal like you into my Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_3,"And in one stroke I have eliminated a threat and gained an invaluable weapon. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_4,YES. I CAN FEEL THE POWER COURSING THROUGH ME. ALL HAIL ULTIMUS!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_5,"Looks like I found you just in time. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_0,Doctor Strange! How did you find us?
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_1,I tracked your life essence across the Plains of Phlogiston.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_2,"Right. Well, whatever else you have up your sleeve, now's the time."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_3,"If you can hold off Thanos, I think I can open a portal back to our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_1_0,By the Ruby Rings of Raggadorr...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_2_0,By the Mystic Moons of Munnopor...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_3_0,By the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_3_1,"Did he just say ""Hoary?"""
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_3_2,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_FAIL_0,THERE IS NO ESCAPE. I WILL CRUSH YOU IN THE NAME OF ULTIMUS!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_0,"By the Fangs of Farallah, we do implore ye passage through..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_1,YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO RUN. ACCEPT YOUR FATE AND SUBMIT.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_2,"Strange, let us come with you. Thanos cannot be saved. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_3,"Follow me and I'll deliver you to safety. Quickly, through the gateway!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_4,"Looks like this is good-bye for now, Purple Haze. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_5,"Just wanted you to know, even though it ultimately ended horribly for you..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_6,With you getting corrupted and now controlled by Ultimus...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_7,"For the briefest of moments there, when we were fighting all those Ravagers... "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_8,I almost considered you...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_9,"A friend. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_10,"Psych! Just kidding! Later, you maniac!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Hello there, friend."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,It's me! Your friendly neighborhood merc with a mouth... Deadpool.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,Today you're in for a treat. I'm giving you exclusive access to a new game I made called...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,Deadpool's MARVEL S.T.R.I.K.E. Force.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_4,"What does the S.T.R.I.K.E. stand for? I'm glad you asked. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_5,"Superhero... Tyrannosaurus... Ridonculous-- No, Retrograde... never mind. It's top secret."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_6,Let's get to the story.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_7,"Once upon a time, a big blue alien named Ultimus invaded Earth and left a trail of destruction that laid waste to one man's most beloved eatery..."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_8,"That place was Mauricio's Chimichanga Emporium. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_9,"That man was me. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_10,"I will have my revenge, and it will be EXTRA SPICY."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_0,"Hey, faceless minion! Bad news for you, buddy. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_1,"I came here to kick red-eyed butt and eat chimichangas, and I'm all out of chimichangas. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_2,Is that Deadpool? I heard you were dead!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_3,Only on the inside.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_4,"Sadly for YOU, I survived the blast that took the life of my most cherished chimichanga restaurant."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_5,"And let me tell you that nothing hurts more than boiling salsa deep inside a third degree burn. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_6,Except maybe what I'm about to do to YOU.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_MID_0,"Well, that was FUN. Tell me what you were doing here, or I'm gonna kill you even harder."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_MID_1,"If you're looking for that mutant we captured, you're too late. He's probably being stuffed into an orb right now. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_MID_2,The plot thickens!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_1_0,"Looks like the merc convoy is about to leave, but they're setting up a bomb to cover their tracks. Not on my watch!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_2_0,Pro-tip: Use my Special Attack and you'll be able to take out that naughty boy that's trying to arm the bomb.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_3_0,"Wait, are you on AUTO PLAY? Use my Special Ability! "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_FAIL_0,Vengeance will be mine! I swear on Thor's bulging biceps!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_END_0,"You done good, boss. We took down all those mercs without even breaking a sweat."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_END_1,"I'm definitely bleeding, but no sweat."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_END_2,Let's make like Quicksilver and follow that convoy.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,Wasn't it great getting to beat the crap out of a bunch of bad guys using my Basic and Special Abilities?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,Now you get to put on my big boy pants and use my Ultimate Attack.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,"We're gonna fight a bunch of goons on a classic New York rooftop, and then find out who they captured..."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,"And Bullseye's gonna be waiting for me and he's gonna be angry for some reason. High drama, there."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,Let's go rescue a hostage!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_0,"It is I, the one and only Deadpool. I am here to save the damsel in distress from the clutches of EVIL."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_1,We've been waiting for you.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_2,"Bullseye said to kill you before you talk us to death. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_3,"I would respond with some pithy comment, but that would just be proving your point."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_4,So instead I'm just going to stand here silently in my idle pose looking menacing and--
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_5,"Oh, I see. It's swords for you, mister!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_0,"Finally, a real challenge. Bullseye, baby!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_1,"If I cut off your head, does your body regrow from there, or do you grow a new head on your headless body?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_2,"Both. I'm an asexual organism. Science, kids. Stay in school."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_3,Let's test that theory!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_END_0,BOOM. Now THAT is how we DO it.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_END_1,"Joke's on you, funny man... the hostage is in another warehouse."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_END_2,"What?! Do I look like an Italian plumber to you? Now I have to start all over! "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,"Logan, Deadpool is wreaking havoc in the streets."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,The last thing we need is a wild card like him running rampant.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,I'll track him down and find out what he's up to.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,"Try to bring him in. He'd be a valuable asset. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,No promises.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_0,Wolverine? Here? What a surprise. I am SHOCKED.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_1,"Quit your yammering, Pool. What are you doing out here roughing up corrupted mercs?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_2,"Outta my way, fuzzy and furious. I've got heroics to do."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_3,"Stand down, or I will put you down. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_4,You are the world's least friendly Canadian. But since you insist...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_0," **** **** **** *********** ******* **************!!!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_1,"Wow, strict language filters in this game. What I meant to say was..."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_2,Ow.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_3,"Fury wants me to bring you in, bub."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_4,"I was THIS CLOSE to rescuing whoever these goons were transferring to Ultimus. \nNow look at us... "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_5,"Hmmm... Something doesn't smell right. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_6,"I'll help you, but you have to stop this rampage. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_7,"I take back everything I ever said about you in the last five minutes! "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_8,"Let's go, friendo!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Oh my gosh, I've been looking forward to this team-up for years. Deadpool and Wolverine. YES."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,"So, what is all that fancy S.T.R.I.K.E. tech telling you about this crime scene? "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_2,Running scan data against S.H.I.E.L.D. records now...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_3,ENHANCE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_4,This can't be possible. It's the Techno-Organic Virus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_5,What a twist! Only Cable carries the T-O Virus. Let's go rescue him!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_START_0,"Oh man, those flaming red eyes are fierce! LOVING IT."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_START_1,"You're too late, human. We've already extracted the Techno-Organic Virus. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_0,I've seen this tech before. Ultimus uses it to corrupt people into slaves.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_1,"So? It's not like he's gonna use the Techno-Organic Virus to corrupt people with a contagious, self-replicating... "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_2,Oh. Oh crap.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_3," 'Nuff said."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,Looks like Cable is being held in this warehouse.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,"If we move in silently, we could--"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,HEY CABLE! YOU IN THERE?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,Never mind.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_START_0,"Spider-Man. OMG OMG OMG! Well, evil Spider-Man. I love you, but I have to eviscerate you to free Cable."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_START_1,Sorry.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_END_0,"Cable, we're here to rescue you!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_END_1,Too late. They've pulled a sample of the Techno-Organic Virus from my blood. They need to be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_END_2,"All the more reason to put that big 'ol gun of yours to use. Lock and load, big guy."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,"Long time, no see, Captain Grumpypants. What in the ever-loving heck is going on here? "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,"In my future, Ultimus failed to conquer Nexus Earth, but that future isn't certain."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,I came to this time to disrupt key moments of victory for Ultimus in hopes of preventing a darker future from materializing.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_3,"Ultimus was waiting for me, then extracted a sample of the Techno-Organic Virus from my system."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_4,Looks like I just made things worse by coming here.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_5,"Wolverine and I are the two best Weapons X ever. We got you, brother!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_6,"We need to destroy the samples of the T-O Virus they took from my blood and torch the whole operation. Let's move. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_0,The corrupted Techno Virus is being stored in this armory up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_1,Follow my lead and we'll have the advantage.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_2,"Kids, this means that with Cable on your team, your squad will start with their speed bars partially filled! Wowzers!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_3,"Looks like they've just got a bunch of ninjas, a magician, and a couple of Norse gods guarding the place. Easy peasy!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_END_0,That was messy. For me I mean. It's gonna take me a few minutes to re-inflate here.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_END_1,"Hurry it up. If this virus is merged with Ultimus's corruption tech, there will be no future left to win."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_0,My sensors have confirmed that the corrupted Techno Virus supply is up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_1,Looks like Thanos is guarding it. He's corrupted.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_2,"Deadpool, Fury will pay you handsomely if you deliver Thanos to us alive."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_3,Handsome is my middle name.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_4,"One Thanos, comin' right up!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_START_0,Deadpool and Cable. These will be the final moments of your insignificant lives.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_START_1,"Hey Cable, does this guy look familiar to you? Look real close. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_START_2,"Alright, let's dance."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_END_0,"One Thanos, as ordered, AND the Techno-Virus samples are torched."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_END_1,"Admit it... We're awesome. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_0,"Fury, we've got Thanos all wrapped up with a bow on him. Wolverine is bringing him back to base."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_1,We'll put him on ice until we can figure out a way to uncorrupt him.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_2,"What, no ""thank you?"" Do we at least get paid now?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_3,Incoming!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_4,"Oh boy, oh boy! It's a minion mash. My favorite."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_5,MAXIMUM EFFORT!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_START_0,Strike down my minions if you must. It shall only make me stronger...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_MID_0,"Alright, this is getting a little stale. How about we just make these guys a little tougher from here on out?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_END_0,Phew! That was a real workout. We got Thanos AND took out the Techno Virus supply. Now we can fly off into the sunset...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_END_1,"Not so fast. The scientists who developed the tech are still out there. We have to stop them, or they'll just make more."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_END_2,"RIGHT ON. I wanted two more missions in this storyline, anyway. More Deadpool shards to give out!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_0,I've traced the corrupted Techno Virus to a lab in Budapest.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_1,Scientist Supreme and Ultron are teaming up to make a new batch of the corrupted virus for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_2,"Jiminy Jillickers, Cable! Whatever shall we do?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_3,"I might just sew your mouth shut. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_4,That's just a ridiculous idea. Who would do that?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_START_0,Alrighty then. Time to take out a sexy scientist and a super genius.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_START_1,"Stay on mission, Deadpool."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_START_2,What? Ultron's got it GOIN' ON! Rawr.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_MID_0,Fools. The perfect form of this virus was created by our greatest mind. You are no match for them.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_END_0,So these chuckleheads aren't even the final bosses?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_END_1,"We should probably go AUTO WIN some campaign missions and gear up, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_END_2,We need to keep moving. Whoever's in charge is up ahead. Stay frosty.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_0,Whoever is in charge of this project is not someone we should take lightly.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_1,I wouldn't have it any other way.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_2,Little did our heroes know that a corrupted Vision was the mastermind of Ultimus's Techno-Organic Virus project.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_3,Soon they would be faced with the greatest challenge of their lives...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_4,Shut up and focus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_5,What do you think I'm doing? This helps me focus my chi. Have some respect.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_6,Namaste.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_0,"Welcome, members of S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_1,You will be the first to see the fruits of my labor. You should feel honored to become one with Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_2,"Not so fast, Robo Gandhi. If we take out your operators, you won't be able to beat us in this mission."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_3,"DP, that's not gonna work. We have to take out Vision first. It's our only shot."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_4,"That's why I love you, Cable. You always go right for the cojones."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_5,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>VISION</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_1_0,Vision's operators are prepping the virus. We need to take him out quickly.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_2_0,"Yeah, if we don't take Vision out, things are gonna get real weird, real fast."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_3_0,"Ok, the pucker factor is a little too high. Get Vision, now!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_FAIL_0,"At last, my virus is airborne. There's no stopping it now."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_0,You fools... I'm trying to save you. With this virus we could have all become one.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_1," --"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_2,"And with that... He was gone. People for years to come would ask, where did Vision go? Why did he do what he did?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_3,The world may never know.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_4,And... Scene.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_5,The fight is long from over.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_6,"With every pivotal moment, Ultimus could own the future. We have to stop him."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_7,And we need S.T.R.I.K.E. to help get it done.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_8,"Right, right, right. That's the perfect segue. Good call, Cable."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_9,"If you help Cable fight enough bad guys in the Deadpool Raids, you might get enough points and wizbangs to unlock me in the game."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_10,Then you can play with me forever.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_11,That came out wrong.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_12,You get the idea.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_13,See you in Raid mode!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_SHIELD_11_01_START_0,"Excuse me, I'm gonna have to see your lanyard if you want to proceed to T.A.H.I.T.I."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_SHIELD_11_01_START_1,Wait... are you a Life-Model Decoy? Halt!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_AIM_12_01_START_0,Behold my greatest creations!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_AIM_12_01_START_1,"And me, too!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_KREE_15_01_START_0,You have been judged! The sentence...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_KREE_15_01_START_1,"More Deadpool! ...Now how do you want to be executed? Guns, swords, or by being gummed to death by toothless weasels?"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_01_START_0,Fisk! What is this rabble doing here!? Be a good chap and order the servants to put bullets in our guests.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_01_START_1,"Right away, Mr. Deadpool, sir."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_02_START_0,"Good help is so hard to find these days. Come on, Fisk. Chop chop!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_02_START_1,"Yes, sir. Very good, sir."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_01_START_0,Ultron-Bots! Roll out!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_01_START_1,"Initiating attack pattern I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_01_START_2,I meant to change that.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_02_START_0,Let's form Ultron! I can form the head!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_02_START_1,"Please, shut up."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_19_HYDRA_01_START_0,DP! We got company!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_19_HYDRA_01_START_1,"Don't worry, Bob. We're Hydra. If they cut off my head, two more take its place!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_28_AVENGERS_01_START_0,Avengers Assemble!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_28_AVENGERS_01_START_1,Hey! It worked this time!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_32_DEFENDERS_01_START_0,Need a blind lawyer? Need a drunk private investigator?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_32_DEFENDERS_01_START_1,Look no further than Deadpool's for Hire!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_30_FRIENDS_01_START_0,All my favorite characters in one mission.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_30_FRIENDS_01_START_1,This is gonna be AWESOME!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_31_BLEED_01_START_0,"Yes, it's true that I wear a red suit so that I don't have to worry about blood stains. "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_31_BLEED_01_START_1,"Kinda makes you wonder about Santa, doesn't it? "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MYSTIC_01_START_0,The Eye of Chimichanga compels you!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_0,"Hi, I'm Deadpool, and this is my friend, Deadpool."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_1,"Hi, I'm Deadpool, and this is my friend, Deadpool.."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_2,"Hi, I'm Deadpool, and this is my friend..."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_3,Hi. I'm Bob.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HULK_SPIDEY_01_START_0,HULK SMASH!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HULK_SPIDEY_01_START_1,DEADPOOL STAB!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HULK_SPIDEY_01_START_2,Why did Ultimus stick me with these guys?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_01_START_0,Cap'n Deadpool! We have stowaways!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_01_START_1,Avast ye scurvy dogs! Defend our borders! Blast them down the black hole of Davy Jones' Locker!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_02_START_0,Why is the rum gone? Where be my booty? Yar!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_03_START_0,Me first-mate and I be taking charge now! We'll be making ye walk the plank!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_01_START_0,Sensei... Intruders have come to defile our inner sanctum!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_01_START_1,"Fear not, young padawan. Remember your training, and Deadpool will set you free."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_02_START_0,Wax on. Wax off. Bird kick! Mercy is for the weak.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Barton, we've had a breach in S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module XR-847B."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,"You're the closest agent to the scene of the incident. Find out how they got in, and why."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,On it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,Stark is not gonna be happy about this...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_4,Not gonna be happy about what? Did Pepper invite you over for dinner despite my objections?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_5,"You know my feelings about things like this. Work-life balance, boundaries."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_6,I need time away from your eye-patch now and then.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_7,A containment module just got cleaned out by some Dark Watch mercs.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_8,"The module was storing the Mask of Ogun, an ancient Kree Monolith, and... "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_9,"I know you like your secrets, Director, but come on. Circle of trust, here. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_10,Your retired Mark VII armor was in it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_11,You lost my super suit? \nThis is why I didn't give my suits to the government in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_12,"Strange that the GPS tracker didn't activate. Suiting up now. I'll handle it. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_13,"Thanks for the offer, Stark, but Barton's team is already on it."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_14,I wasn't offering. \nTell Clint I'll be there in five.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_0,I've got eyes on the perps. Looks like a surgical raid.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_1,"They knew what they were looking for. Trucks are already loaded up and rolling out. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_2,"So, S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks it can catch up with us? Too bad, too slow."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_3,Let's see what kind of damage a remote-controlled Iron Man suit can do. Switch that thing on!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_4,Bring it on. I could use the exercise.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_MID_0,"They ACTIVATED my suit, too? Okay, now I'm upset. I set up the security protocol on that module personally."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_MID_1,"Tony, as long as you don't start turning green on me, I'm good with you fighting angry."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_0,"Took care of these guys pretty quickly. Thankfully, I might even be able to salvage that suit."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_1,"Sentimental value, you know?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_2,"That's nice, Tony, \nbut those guys made off with the Mask of Ogun and that Kree Monolith before we got here."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_3,"Mercs have no use for artifacts like those. We need to find out what they plan to do with them. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_4,"Count me in. I want to know who hacked my systems, and then I want to bring them down a peg."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,"Daisy, Tony and I are in pursuit of the mercenaries."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,Any chatter out there on the dark web linked to our missing cargo?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,Search algorithms have flagged a meeting on a rooftop in Hell's Kitchen. Starts in fifteen minutes.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,Who's on the guest list? What's the planned entertainment for the evening?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,"Mercenaries, Hand Ninjas, and the Mask of Ogun. It's gonna be a blast."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_5,"That's the idea... right after I bombard them with a salvo of micro rockets. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_0,"Look, this thing is hot, and we need to move it right now. Do you want the mask or not?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_1,You fools... You were followed!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_2,I expect a heavy discount for your carelessness. Koroshite yaru!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_3,"Clint, maybe we should just sit back and watch them insult each other to death. No? Fine, let's smoke 'em."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_END_0,"You think stopping us here means anything? You know nothing, Stark."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_END_1,"Oh yeah? Then fill me in, cupcake, before I laser beam you where the sun don't shine."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_END_2,The Legion cannot be stopped. Humanity is theirs for the taking...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,"Got my suit back, got the mask, what's next on our scavenger hunt?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,That ancient Kree Monolith.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,"Right, right. Mr. Soldier of Fortune back there mentioned something about ""The Legion."" Any idea what he's talking about?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,Alpha Flight records link the phrase to a Kree rogue faction called the Lunatic Legion.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,"In the wake of Ultimus's invasion, these guys have been working to recover ancient Kree relics all over the world."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_5,So they're a bunch of evil blue Indiana Joneses? Noted.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_6,"Clint, time to bring the fight to these mercs' doorstep. We got a read on their safehouse yet?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_7,Affirmative. They work out of an abandoned Hydra armory.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_8,Of course they do.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_0,"Humans, prove yourselves worthy of the gifts you have been given."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_1,Defeat these fools from S.H.I.E.L.D. and earn your place within the Legion.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_2,Looks like we know who wears the pants in this crew.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_3,Have fun taking out the mercs. I've got the blue one.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_0,"Tony, you seeing what I'm seeing? These mercs have blue patches of skin."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_1,That better not be contagious.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_2,"Hard to say, but it looks like it's spreading across this guy's whole body."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_3,"Hey Smurfette, you wanna tell us what's going on here with your happy little army of blue-ish mooks?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_4,"I speak for my master, Kona Lor. We are the Lunatic Legion."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_5,"If you are looking for the Monolith, it is now back in the hands of true Kree believers thanks to aid from Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_6,Salvation will soon be at hand for all humans that are deemed worthy.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_7,"So, a group of Kree fanatics want to cleanse the Earth of humanity? And you're working for Ultimus?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_8,"Couldn't think of anything more original, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_9,"What, you're not gonna carve the Monolith into a statue of Ronan and present it as a wedding gift to the Supreme Intelligence?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_10,I gotta say... I'm a LITTLE disappointed right now.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Agent Johnson, where are we with the analysis on those mercs with the blue skin?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,"Tony, we've brought in our very best S.H.I.E.L.D. Medic to run tests on the subjects."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_2,"I'll patch you through. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_3,"Mr. Stark, analysis of the subjects recovered at the armory shows a new form of Terrigenesis in their systems."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_4,So the Lunatic Legion is turning humans into Inhumans?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_5,No. This is more comprehensive. The process changes the genetic code of someone and makes them into a full-blooded Kree.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_6,And taking control of the Kree Monolith gives them access to a massive cache of Terrigen...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_7,which could make this thing at risk of going global.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_8,"Daisy, have you been able to track down the Monolith yet?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_9,I've been scanning the surface of the moon since the Lunatic Legion has been known to operate from there in the past.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_10,It appears a transmission was in fact sent from the armory to the Blue Area of the Moon just before we raided it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_11,"Hey Clint, ever wanted to go take a walk on the moon?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_12,Walk? Not so much.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_13,Always wanted to know how far I could shoot an arrow from there.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_START_0,"Tony, you notice how all these Kree zealots aren't even corrupted?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_START_1,"I guess it's easy to declare loyalty to a guy like Ultimus, who hates humans as much as they do."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_MID_0,A corrupted Yondu? Here? Don't these guys know he's Centaurian and not Kree?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_MID_1,"Shows how much you know, tin man. They MADE me into a Kree."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_MID_2,Full-blooded and everything. Now I'm stronger than ever!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_END_0,"You fools. With the Terrigen Crystals in our hands, there's nothing you can do to stop the Grand Design."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_END_1,"Oh, they even have a special name for their terrifying ritual. Nice."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but that lab up ahead sure as heck looks like an A.I.M. lab."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,I should have bought that company and fired them all when I had the chance.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,Who else would happily make an atmospheric bomb that gives people a case of the Kreebie-Jeebies for a bunch of zealots?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,Because science.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_0,Tony! How nice to see you!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_1,"Check it out, my very own moon base. What do you think?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_2,"Listen up, Nacho Supreme."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_3,"Put down the beakers, turn off the Bunsen burners, and hand over your science fair project."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_4,"Oh, please. You can't seriously be angry with me?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_5,Everybody needs a little side hustle!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_0,"Ok, playtime's over. Cough it up, Craziness Supreme."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_1,I'm sorry to inform you that you arrived here too late.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_2,The Lunatic Legion has already taken the Terrigen Bomb to their warship.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_3,Give me one good reason I shouldn't quarantine you in that airlock.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_4,"There's no need for ill manners, \nMr. Stark. It's just science. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_5,Take this vaccine with you. It will likely nullify the cocktail within the bomb.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_6,Hold up... you made a vaccine for a weapon that you gave to Ultimus's cronies?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_7,What kind of a scientist engineers a plague without making a vaccine? \nDo you think I'm insane?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_8,...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_9,...just hand it over.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,"Alright, team, no more messing around."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,Time to hit 'em where it hurts.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,"Clint, we've got a Kree warship to assault and a bomb to disable."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_3,"Roger that, Tony."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_START_0,"Team, we have orders to keep these guys from the bridge. Make it so."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_START_1,"Huh. Well, now I know how they breached my security protocols."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_START_2,"Friday, make a note to update all my logins to use eight-factor authentication."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_END_0,"Stark, you need to hurry. The ship is approaching Earth's atmosphere."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_END_1,Working on it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_INTRO_0,Friday is telling me that there is a squad of corrupted Avengers protecting the bomb up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_INTRO_1,Ready for a doppelganger fight?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_INTRO_2,Wouldn't have it any other way.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_START_0,"Hey everybody, look! It's Tony Stark, the big brave hero, and he's come to save the day!"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_START_1,"Hah! That guy is a dead ringer for you, Tony."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_START_2,"Oh please, I do not sound like that. Wait. Do I?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_0,Not good. They've set the ship on a crash course for the Pacific Ocean.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_1,"Tony, get that vaccine into the bomb's viral release cannister before we hit atmo!"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_2,Way ahead of you.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_3,Just a twist to the left... and... it's locked in!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_4,"It's done. There's nothing else we can do for this ship, time to get out of Dodge!"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_5,"Hang on tight, Hawkeye. I'll fly you out of here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_0,"Ant-Man, S.T.R.I.K.E. needs your help."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_1,"Wow, me? Seriously? What do you need me to steal?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_2,Nothing. We need a different set of skills this time around.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_3,Deadpool is storming a facility that houses the corrupted Techno Virus. We need you to go in and disable the distribution device.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_4,"Have you asked Hope to help on this one? You know, to make sure I don't screw things up this time?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_5,The Wasp is off on a different operation with Black Widow. You're on your own this time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_6,"Alright, Scott... You can DO this..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_7,"Okay, listen up. This facility is controlled by a corrupted Vision."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_8,We need you to get in and disable the security grid so we can sneak your support team in.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_9,"And Lang, try not to accidentally go Giant-Man on us while in transit."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_10,Last time your enormous butt crushed my favorite laptop.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_11,"Yeah, that was an unfortunate mishap. Sorry."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_0,"Okay, going tiny to sneak in went smoothly."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_1,This should be a piece of cake as long as I can evade the guards.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_2," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_3,"Good plan, Scott. Good plan."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_4,USE ANT-MAN'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>ABILITY BLOCK</color> AN ENEMY.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_5,USE HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>SLOW</color> ALL OPPONENTS AT ONCE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_END_0,"I've disabled the security grid. Team is a go to infiltrate the... uh, facility, post haste... now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_END_1,Just... Never mind. You get what I'm saying.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_0,The Techno Virus distribution device is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_1,How do you know? Seems kind of weird that an all-powerful A.I. like Vision would just leave that kind of info sitting around.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_2,"It took me weeks of analyzing intel, combing through building blueprints, disassembling stolen tech, and interrogating captured Kree."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_3,Well... Okay then. Good on you!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_0,"Alright, you guys, I'm just here for the distribution device. I don't want to fight you if I don't have to."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_1,You have to fight us.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_2,It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_3,"Fine. But for the record, I asked."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_END_0,Deadpool is engaging Vision in the processing center.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_END_1,"PARRY, DODGE, RIPOSTE!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_END_2,Time to go disable the device. Easy peasy.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_0,Looks like all my favorite heroes are guarding the device up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_1,And I'm going to have to beat them all up. This sucks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_2,"Ant-Man, we've got an incoming transmission from Wasp."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_3,I'll get it later. We have important work to do.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_START_0,"Alright, team, listen up."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_START_1,"These guys are all my idols, so... I might need some help taking them out. Appreciate the assist."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_0,That fight's gonna be a tough one to erase from my memory...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_1,"Lang, the device."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_2,Oh. Right. On it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_3,Right after I take a peak inside that shiny-looking vault over there... \nCan't pass THAT up...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_4,Huh. It's just an orb chamber. But a REALLY fancy-looking one...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_5,Woah.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_0,"Distribution device disabled. You're good to go, Deadpool."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_1,"Thanks, Ant-Man! By the way, REALLY digging that suit of yours."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_2,SMOKE BOMB!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_3," --"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_4,"Did he just shout ""Smoke bomb?"""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_5,"Lang, I've finished scanning the orb chamber you found inside that vault."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_6,It's unlike anything we've seen before. This chamber is capable of storing incredible amounts of energy inside a single orb.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_7,"See, THIS is why I steal stuff. What's the plan?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_8,Similar energy readings were recently found at an abandoned H.A.M.M.E.R. warehouse.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_9,I'm sending a team in. You want in?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_10,In like Flynn.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_11,Who's Flynn?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_12,Never mind.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_START_0,"It's okay to beat up these S.H.I.E.L.D. guys since they're corrupted, right? Still feels wrong..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_END_0,The energy trail leads inside. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_INTRO_0,Looks like there's a crate of orbs in here that match what we're looking for.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_INTRO_1,"I'm guessing there are a bunch of corrupted jerks guarding it, too? Game time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_START_0,These orbs are the property of the one true Vision. Leave now or feel the wrath of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_START_1,"Wait, corrupted Vision escaped?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_START_2,"See, what'd I say? Jerks."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_0,That's the last of them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_1,"Lang, the readings for this orb are off the charts."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_2,We need to bring this orb back to the Helicarrier for further analysis.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_3,Bring a mysterious super-charged orb back onto our flying aircraft carrier. Sounds safe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_0,"Agent Johnson, I just attempted to perform a cursory scan of the orb."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_1,But there's some sort of stasis field blocking my scanners.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_2,Too bad I can't shrink a whole squad into the orb to investigate from the inside.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_3,Actually... that might now be possible.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_4,"After pooling our resources together for S.T.R.I.K.E., Hank Pym recently made a breakthrough."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_5,We can now create a force field and safely shrink everything inside.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_6,So let me get this straight.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_7,"Hank made some new tech that would greatly enhance our ability to work with Pym Particles, and he didn't tell me about it?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_8,Yep.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_9,That makes sense.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_10,"So now, all we have to do is disrupt a small section of the stasis field..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_11,"And then, using new experimental Pym tech, shrink us as a team inside the gap."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_12,What could possibly go wrong?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_13," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_14,"Maybe if I STOPPED talking, bad guys would stop showing up right afterwards."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_START_0,Surrender now and you will have the honor to join the ranks of the one true Vision's enlightened sect.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_START_1,"Is that an evil cult? That sounds like an evil cult. NO, THANK YOU."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_START_2,Your window for shrinking inside that orb will be limited. Cover me while I prepare the temporary disruption.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_1_0,Stasis disrupter powering up...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_2_0,Kinetic dampers activated. Almost there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_3_0,Field disruption point acquired. Preparing for rapid reduction activation...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_FAIL_0,Our operator is down. No way inside that orb now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_END_0,Field disruption is stable. Go now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_END_1,Let's do this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_END_2,"Lang, Bucky and I are with you. \nTime to get small!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_INTRO_0,"Huh, this is interesting... Looks like a giant, well, tiny, megastructure inside this orb."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_INTRO_1,I think I can see some kind of access door down there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_0,What. Is. This?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_1,Prepare for conversion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_2,There's a tiny jungle in here. With tiny cranes. And even tiny corrupted Hydra forces.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_3,Of course there are.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_0,"Lang, what the heck are we even LOOKING at in here?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_1,"Now, I could be wrong, I'm just an electrical engineer..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_2,But I THINK we're on some sort of tiny version of... Earth?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_3,Inside some kind of a planetary Dyson Sphere? It's got an artificial sun in here and everything.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_4,Sure. Still not the strangest place I've been.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_0,"My scans have confirmed this definitely resembles our Earth, just a lot... smaller?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_1,What about that fleet of Kree warships off in the distance over there?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_2,It looks like Ultimus is planning some sort of tiny invasion from here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_3,"Let's head back outside, grow to normal size, tell S.T.R.I.K.E., maybe then chuck this thing into the sun..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_4," ...after we fight this tiny Thanos and his tiny daughters. Of course."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_START_0,"You may have found this planet, but you will never leave it alive."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_START_1,We will make sure of that. It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_START_2,Shouldn't you be off looking for an itty bitty infinity gauntlet? Leave us out of this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_0,"Okay, let's get the heck off of this rock."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_1,Can't happen fast enough...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_2,"Initiating growth sequence, stand by..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_3,"Quake, you will not believe what we found inside this thing."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_4,"Lang, not now! We are under attack. Get back up here and help us!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_0,What's going on? Who's attacking us!?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_1,Who do you think? That corrupted Vision has launched a full-on assault on the Helicarrier.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_2,"Hey Tiny Dude, get your squad out here and ready to fight."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_3,"Yes sir, Hawkeye, sir. Right away, sir!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_4,"Stop saying, ""sir."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_5,"Yes, sir. I mean, sorry, sir. Sorry."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_START_0,"Oh man, that orb was crazy! There's a tiny Earth inside there. A tiny Earth!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_START_1,"Focus, Lang. One full-blown crisis at a time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_START_2,Fair enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_0,So that mega orb has a tiny planet inside. And there's a tiny Kree invasion!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_1,That structure simulates sunlight and is suspending the entire planet somehow and...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_2," --Look that's great and all, but we have a major problem."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_3,Indeed. Disrupting the stasis field has made the orb unstable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_4,It's only a matter of time before the orb explodes in a massive supernova. Quite fascinating!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_5,A regular massive supernova or a tiny massive supernova?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_6,"Never mind, that sounds bad regardless."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_7,"Yep. This is beyond our expertise, Lang. We need Hope."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_8,Time to give her a call. Now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_9,THAT sounds like fun...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_10,"Hey Hope, Scott here. Man oh man have I got a story for you..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_11,What did you screw up this time?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_12,"Can you help us figure out how to prevent a tiny version of Earth from exploding? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_13," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_14,I'm on my way.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_0,"Wasp, any luck tracking down the Hydra team that stole the cache of Pym tech from your company's facilities?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_1,I managed to trace the energy signature of the tech to a facility in the heart of the city.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_2,We can't let that tech fall into Hydra hands.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_3,I'll do some light recon. Be ready to bring in the cavalry when I give you the go-ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_0,Huh. Wasn't expecting to see a bunch of corrupted Scott Langs working as Hydra lackeys.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_1,"Yeah, well joke's on you, lady. We're the Ant-Men, and we're here to fumigate you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_2,Okay. Now I can officially confirm that even the corrupted versions of you are dorks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_3,USE WASP'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>STUN</color> A TARGET WHEN CHARGED.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_4,"USE HER <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>ATTACK ALL</color>, EVEN <color=#fff568>STEALTHED</color> TARGETS."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_END_0,That was a lot more fun than it should have been. Time to see what Hydra is doing here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_END_1,"But first, I should call Scott and tell him about this nonsense..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_INTRO_0,"Entrance is secured. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_INTRO_1,Confirmed. Get ready to move in.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_START_0,"Squad, looks like you got here just in time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_START_1,Time is the LAST thing you've got.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_END_0,Analysis indicates this facility was being used to construct an orb chamber.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_END_1,An orb chamber harnessing Pym Particles? No wonder they had such a tough squad guarding it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_END_2,Not tough enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_0,Energy signatures are spiking in the processing sector up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_1,Then it's a good thing we're here to put a stop to this operation.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_2,I'm seeing signs that Wakandan tech is being used here. That combined with Pym tech...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_3,Will prove to be your end.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_START_0,Pym's technology is truly a marvel. When combined with my people's technology --
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_START_1,It gives me twice as many reasons to stop you from using it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_0,What's so important about the orbs that can be made in this chamber?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_1,Imagine being able to store the energy of a star or a planet in a single orb.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_2,Or having a Kree Noble unleash a massive space fleet from the palm of her hands.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_3,Let's just hope they haven't made any orbs with one of these things yet.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_4,I've got a call coming in from Scott. One sec.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_5,"Hey Hope, Scott here. Man oh man have I got a story for you..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_6,What did you screw up this time?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_0,So let me get this straight...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_1,"You found a mysterious orb, went inside and found a tiny Earth, and now it's going to explode."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_2,"In a nutshell, yeah. Well, an orb. You get the idea."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_3,I was telling these guys that we should just fire it at the sun and be done with it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_4,"And, what, just incinerate the billions of tiny people in the process?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_5,"Oh, right. Yeah, that's a terrible plan. Maybe you should be coming up with the plans."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_6,We'll focus our resources on further analyzing the origin of the orb's contents.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_7,"I'll track down corrupted Vision's ship, see if we can find any information on where this micro-planet came from."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_8,"And keep an eye on Ant-Man while I'm at it. You know, make sure he doesn't accidentally set off any other super bombs."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_9,"Nice. That's... Yeah, that's fair."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_0,So how are we going to find corrupted Vision's ship?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_1,I just sent out a distress call to corrupted forces asking for assistance from his team.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_2,Working with you is SO much easier than working alone.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_3,<color=#fff568>ANT-MAN</color> AND <color=#fff568>WASP</color>\nARE VERY EFFECTIVE <color=#fff568>TOGETHER</color> IN COMBAT.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_4,ANT-MAN'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color>\nGIVES THEM BOTH A <color=#fff568>POSITIVE EFFECT</color> FROM THE TARGET.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_5,"WHEN BRINGING <color=#fff568>BOTH HEROES</color> INTO A FIGHT,\nANT-MAN'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> IS MUCH STRONGER."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_END_0,"Now that we took them out, we can take their shuttle and use autopilot to return to Vision's ship."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_END_1,You make this look so easy! It never goes this smooth for me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_0,"Further analysis of the mini-Earth shows that it is from another fallen dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_1,Ultimus has found a way to shrink the entire planet using Pym tech.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_2,So if we return the orb to its dimension and find a way to reverse the process...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_3,We could save the planet before it becomes too unstable and explodes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_4,"But these mini-guys are bad guys, right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_5,"They're not bad, Scott. Just corrupted by Ultimus. It's the right thing to do."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_6,That doesn't come naturally to me. But I promised I would try harder so...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_7,Let's do it. As long as I get to change my name to Captain Mini-Planet.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_8,No.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_9,Fine.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_0,Be on the lookout for all kinds of strange experiments Vision may have been working on.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_1,I... AM... ULTIMUS...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_2," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_3,"Okay, obviously this Groot has been genetically modified so it can speak in a way that we can understand more easily."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_4,So that DID just happen? I'm not losing my mind after all?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_5,"You're a lot of things, Scott, but you're not crazy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_MID_0,"You're Ant Person and The Wasp, right? Yeah, Vision wants you, like, 200% more dead."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_MID_1,Here I go killin' again!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_0,Well that was a fun dumpster fire to deal with. What's next?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_1,A dozen 60-foot tall Rocket Raccoons?\nA horde of A.I.M. minions shooting tiny A.I.M. minions out of their mouths?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_2,What?! Where?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_3,Just a hypothetical. Jumpy much?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_0,The vessel's command center is up ahead. Vision is bound to be in there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_1,"If Deadpool and Cable couldn't finish him off, how are we gonna beat him?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_2,For starters? We can make ourselves small enough to go inside one of his nanites and corrupt it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_3,Thereby starting a chain reaction which will make him de-materialize! Good idea.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_4,The odds of executing such a plan are far from probable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_5,But I certainly welcome the challenge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_0,What is it you hope to accomplish by coming here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_1,Your little experiment with Pym tech has made this whole planet unstable. We're setting it right.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_2,Ultimus will not allow it. This experiment is too valuable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_3,"Oh yeah? Well we're gonna blow up all your research, too. So there!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_4,"Next time let's not telegraph our plans to the bad guys, okay, Scott?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_0,"Vision is finished, finally.\nAnd we located the dimensional rift where this planet comes from."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_1,The rift is in China.\nDeploying a team now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_2,Can we stop at that place with all the pandas on our way? I've always wanted to hug a panda.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_3,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_4,Right. Maybe AFTER we send mini-Earth back to its home and reverse the process.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_5,Then pandas.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_INTRO_0,We need to send the orb through the rift and reverse the process. This orb is de-stabilizating fast.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_INTRO_1,"Yep, and all we gotta do is beat the crap out of all those ninjas guarding the portal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_START_0,We will protect this portal with our lives.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_START_1,Bummer.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_END_0,"Okay, the path is clear."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_END_1,Right behind you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_0,It's too bad we can't take anything with us from tiny Earth before we send it home.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_1,Like a keepsake?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_2,"Yeah, like an Eiffel Tower key chain that is the ACTUAL Eiffel Tower. Something like that."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_3,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_4,Right. Do the right thing. No stealing of national monuments.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_0,The Hand of Ultimus will never let you near his most prized dimension.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_1,"Ant-Man and The Wasp disagree. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_2,"Are we going with ""Ant-Man and Wasp"" or ""Wasp and Ant-Man?"" And do you prefer ""The Wasp"" or just ""Wasp?"""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_3,"Scott, shut up and fight."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_END_0,"Hope, you need to hurry. That thing is going to explode in a matter of minutes."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_END_1,Vision's team set up a lab in here surrounding the portal. This is our only chance to do this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_END_2,Better make it count.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_0,"Oh, great. YOU again."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_1,I was about to say the same thing about you. Your attempts to reach this portal will prove futile.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_2,Not if I have anything to say about it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_3,"This is going to be even more fun than beating up a dozen pathetic versions of you, Scott."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_4,"Wait, what?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_START_0,"As long as we take out the last of Vision's scientists, we can reverse the process and save the micro-Earth."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_START_1,"I was going with ""mini-Earth"" but ""micro-Earth"" works, too."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_1_0,Evil Wasp is trying to force the portal closed before we can get to it!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_1_1,"Take out those operators, and we still have a fighting chance."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_1_2,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_2_0,We need to focus on those operators. No time to waste.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_3_0,"If that portal closes, we're all toast. That means no pandas, no more tiny people, no more us!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_FAIL_0,"The portal's closed! And the orb, it's about to --"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_0,"Quake, quick! Initiate the unlock sequence on the orb. I've got it on the other side of the portal!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_1,Stasis field disabling in 3... 2... 1...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_2,Stasis field disabled. The shrinking process is reverting...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_3,Confirmed. The planet formerly known as micro-Earth is stable and back to its normal size.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_4,Roger that.\nClosing the portal off for good.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_5,"Hey Hope, you were right. Doing the right thing DOES feel good."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_6,"Maybe there's hope for you yet, Scott."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_7,Hold on. What's that in your hand?\nIs that the Eiffel Tower?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_8,No. I mean... maybe? Fine. Yes.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_0,"Fury, if we are going to win this war, we need to attack Ultimus on all fronts."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_1,"Allow me to send mercenaries to fallen dimensions and ""relieve"" Ultimus of his gold holdings."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_2,Interesting... What makes gold so important to Ultimus?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_3,The Kree people love gold. Especially gold from conquered worlds.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_4,"If Ultimus loses gold acquired from his conquests, it will send ripples through the multiverse. Plus, it will fill our coffers in our time of need."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_5,"So you're telling me we can get a bunch of gold, piss off Ultimus, and make the Kree nobility turn their noses up at him?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_6,"Rally your soldiers of fortune. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_7,"Bullseye, time to put on your finest suit. Gold is on the menu for today."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_START_0,This first stockpile is gonna be easy pickings.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_START_1,"Plus, it's guarded by corrupted heroes.\nMy favorite."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_END_0,"Alright, let's load up the gold and blow this popsicle stand."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_END_1,"Wait, you want to blow the place up too?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_END_2,"Not what I meant, but sure, why not?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_INTRO_0,Your next target is more heavily fortified. Be prepared.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_INTRO_1,GOOD. I did the last one with my eyes closed.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_START_0,We've been expecting you.\nUltimus demands your blood.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_START_1,Yeah... but you brought a fist to a knife fight.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_END_0,"That was a mess, but we secured the gold."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_END_1,"Yeah, maybe it's time we started looking for extra help..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_0,"Fisk, we need to bolster our numbers if we want to keep this up."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_1,Run-of-the-mill mercs aren't going to cut it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_2,"Be careful what you wish for, Lester."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_3,Oh my god... Your name is LESTER? SO MANY WAYS I CAN GO WITH THIS!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_4," ..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_5,"You know what, Fisk? We're good. Don't need the help..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_START_0,Ultimus has had enough with your band of hirelings.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_START_1,I will personally see to it your crime spree ends here.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_START_2,"Wouldn't be much of a ""spree"" if you stopped it now, would it? "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_0,"Hey, big guy, we both have Wilson in our name. We already have two thirds of a Wilson Phillips cover band."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_1,"We should find a Phillips and go on tour. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_2,"See what I mean, Fisk? I can't take it any more."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_3,"Quit the chatter, Deadpool. Stealing money is serious business."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_0,I've located a massive stockpile of gold.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_1,The gold cache is on an Earth ravaged by meteorites... and corrupted Avengers.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_2,Dodging falling junk while fighting giant green rage monsters?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_3,WHERE DO I SIGN UP?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_START_0,Stop. These riches belong to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_START_1,"Each time you say the word ""stop"" and don't immediately follow it up with ""Hammer Time""..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_START_2,I'm going to shoot you for a missed opportunity.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_END_0,Goal for Deadpool! The crowd goes wild!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_0,So you're like some sort of cosmic bounty hunter?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_1," ..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_2,"Strong silent type. I get that. Maybe I should try to be silent too? No, really, look, here I go."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_3," ..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_4,Nope. Terrible. Hate it. Never again.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_START_0,So lovely to have guests! A pity we have to kill you immediately.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_START_1,The hunt begins.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_START_2,It speaks!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_END_0,This horde of gold is... It's too much!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_END_1,Not a problem. That's what my supply of Pym Particle Disks is for.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_END_2,I'm sure Ant-Man can appreciate the irony that I stole them from him.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_0,"Hey Fisk, where do you keep getting all this intel from?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_1,"Are you catfishing Ultimus? I mean, the dude is evil incarnate but even that seems kind of low. I expect more from you!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_2,It's amazing the things you learn when torturing a corrupted Deadpool over and over again until he spills the beans on all of Ultimus's gold reserves.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_3,Huh... that's... dark...
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_4,A vault of great importance to Ultimus is located on the surface of this dimension's Mars. Clean it out.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_START_0,We are the Guardians of the Vault.\nPrepare to meet your end.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_START_1,"Yeah, you need to work on that name."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_0,What the heck is Ultimus even storing in this thing?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_1,Gold. More gold. Some works of art created in his honor.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_2,Yeah... I see why he hides that painting in here. His nose looks HUGE.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_3,I bet that artist no longer has a home planet.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_0,Time for the big one.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_1,This dimension is ruled by a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. regime.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_2,Hijack their primary Helicarrier and loot the contents within.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_3,Sounds like my kind of party.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_0,"So you're trying to rob a Helicarrier, huh? Cute."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_1,"This is about the gold, not my dashing good looks."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_2,"Lester, please. I'm better looking than you, and I look like a shaved hedgehog."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_3,Why must he always be talking...
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_4,You LITERALLY have a target on your face. What do you expect?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_0,It's done.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_1,Good. Now we have enough gold to fund S.T.R.I.K.E. operations for years to come.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_2,"And this will spawn rebellions against Ultimus among the Kree. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_3,"Kingpin, keep the details of this matter between us. These resources need to remain secret. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, for centuries the Hand have searched for an ancient sword of great importance to my people: the Yokai No Odachi."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_1,"With help from S.T.R.I.K.E., we discovered members of Ultimus's army are in possession of a piece of the sword."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_2,"Once we have the Odachi, the Hand of this dimension will be connected to our people across all the realms."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_3,Do what you must to recover the relic. I'd rather see you with the sword than Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_4,"Elektra, gather our brothers and sisters to handle this important endeavor."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_START_0,Beware of these corrupted pawns of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_START_1,They have enhanced reflexes and will strike with lethal precision.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_END_0,This corrupted Hand Sentry was protecting a piece of the Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_END_1,Secure it in our stronghold while we search for the remaining six pieces of the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_END_2,It shall be done.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_INTRO_0,We've tracked down the second piece of the Yokai No Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_INTRO_1,"However, it appears a corrupted Kingpin and Korath have gotten to it first."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_INTRO_2,Eliminate them and find out why corrupted forces are trying to recover the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_START_0,It appears the shattered remnants of the Hand also seek the Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_START_1,Their attempts will end in failure. It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_END_0,We have recovered the second piece of the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_END_1,But why does Ultimus want the sword? This is an ill omen.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_INTRO_0,It is concerning that Ultimus is sending corrupted forces after the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_INTRO_1,"If they secure the pieces, they will corrupt Hand warriors across all dimensions with a single ritual."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_INTRO_2,"We will stop them, I swear it."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_START_0,Mordo's powers have enhanced the dark energy emanating from these corrupted.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_START_1,It will be difficult for us to channel our healing arts. Prepare yourselves.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_END_0,Mordo had the third piece of the sword. We are making progress.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_END_1,Do not grow overconfident. There are still four pieces out there. Make haste.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_END_2,Perhaps it is time to utilize other S.T.R.I.K.E. assets to find the remaining pieces of the relic.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_INTRO_0,"Matthew, what do you have for me?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_INTRO_1,The fourth piece of the relic is in the hands of corrupted Guardians.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_INTRO_2,Lovely. I was wondering when Ultimus would give us a real challenge.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_0,Hand over the piece of the relic now and we will spare you.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_1,HAND over the piece? Really? Too easy.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_2,Ultimus gave me some cutting edge Kree ammo from the armory.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_3,Say hello to my little friend!
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_END_0,We now have the fourth piece of the Yokai No Odachi. Three more to go...
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_INTRO_0,"The fifth piece of the sword is likely in Warsaw, which was recently attacked by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_INTRO_1,We must find it and keep it from the corrupted forces in the area.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_INTRO_2,It shall be done.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_START_0,"Ms. Natchios, you are of course too late to recover your precious artifact."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_START_1,"But do not fret, my lady. You will soon have the esteemed honor of dying by my hands."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_END_0,Five pieces recovered. We are so close.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_END_1,Not as close as you think. We need to talk.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_0,"I've discovered that corrupted Hand forces are in possession of the final two fragments of the sword in Hakone, Japan."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_1,They no longer need the pieces you found.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_2,They are close to deconstructing versions of the Odachi from other dimensions to restore the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_3,Then we must hurry. Otherwise Ultimus will destroy our way of life. IKUZO!
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_START_0,Corrupted Elektra and her assassins are blocking the path.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_START_1,Then show them the error of their ways.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_END_0,We have recovered the sixth piece of the Yokai No Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_END_1,None of that will matter if they can still restore the blade with fragments from other dimensions.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_END_2,SUSUME!
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_INTRO_0,We will not allow these false Hand soldiers to restore the Odachi for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_INTRO_1,We must eliminate them once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_INTRO_2,"By our honor, we will not fail.\nFOR THE HAND!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_START_0,You ninjas really think you can stop this? Ultimus will have his prize.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_START_1,Not if I have anything to say about it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_0,We have all seven pieces of the true Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_1,The Hand have won this battle once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_2,"Fury, we can now reach out to our other brothers and sisters en masse."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_3,A multidimensional horde of ninjas fighting by our side? Works for me.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_0,"Captain Quill, I've got a task that you and your Cosmic allies might be able to help S.T.R.I.K.E. with."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_1,Ultimus is testing a hybrid Odium serum on his soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_2,It makes them enraged with super strength but with none of the usual weaknesses.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_3,"As in, the Odium doesn't eventually kill them after taking it?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_4,Exactly.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_5,That sucks.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_6,I'll pull the crew together.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_START_0,"Hey Korath, back away from the Odium...\nOr else. Cuz Star-Lord's here!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_START_1,WHO?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_START_2,"You know what, every Korath I come across says that. Not cool, bro."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_END_0,And THAT'S what happens when you mess with the Guardians... and Ravagers... of S.T.R.I.K.E.!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_END_1,I definitely thought that would sound better.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_0,What's the deal with Odium anyway? Why would people drink something like that?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_1,"In Kree culture, when a soldier is outnumbered without hope of surviving, they drink Odium."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_2,"All strength, no pain. A fearsome last stand. A fitting end for a warrior seeking glory."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_3,That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Who the heck kills themselves over something like that?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_4,Typical Kree Noble nonsense.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_5,"If it would help protect any of you, I would do it without hesitation."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_6,"Dang it, Gamora, why'd you gotta go and say that? You're gonna make me all weepy, you jerk!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_0,"This Odium supply belongs to Ultimus. Leave this place, or you will be destroyed."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_1,Do you have tickets yet?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_2,"Umm, to what?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_3,To the gun show! Pew pew pew!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_END_0,"Two supply lines down, a whole buttload more to go."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_END_1,Good. Then there is only a small amount remaining.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_0,"Listen up, Robocop. Turn over the Odium and... that giant pile of high-tech assault weapons."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_1,Or what?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_2,"Or... We're gonna have a gunfight. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_3,Works for me.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_MID_0,Hi there! You're all trespassing on sacred land belonging to Ultimus. Prepare to die!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_MID_1,Hasselhofftopia remembers!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_MID_2,This is my nightmare.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_END_0,That... was... AWESOME!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_START_0,This latest Odium formula is my greatest achievement.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_START_1,Ultimus WILL have it. We cannot be stopped!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_END_0,"I swear, EVERY time science goes bad, SHE is ALWAYS there."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_END_1,Tell me about it. I'm just happy corrupted versions of YOU aren't running the show.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_END_2,"Yeah, you'd all be screwed if that ever happened."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_0,"Finally, the ultimate test of my strength. If I die today, I know I will have been bested by my superior."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_1,You are a wise and handsome man.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_2,As are you.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_3,Can we PLEASE just start fighting already?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_END_0,I am GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_END_1,Without a doubt! Now all we have to do is find that Odium factory.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_0,Huh. Looks like Ultimus sent Loki to stop us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_1,You think he'll give a villainous monologue and tell us where Ultimus's Odium factory is located?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_2,"Ah, the infamous Star-Lord honors us with his presence."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_3,"And his illustrious band of misfits, oh this keeps getting better and better..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_4,"Tell you what... You will all be dead soon, so I suppose it doesn't matter."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_5,The Odium factory is housed on a Kree warship in orbit around planet Berhert.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_6,Um... Thanks?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_END_0,"Rocket, put in the coordinates for Berhert. Let's end this."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_END_1,On it!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_START_0,That corrupted Loki never mentioned ANYTHING about a corrupted Ultimus AND Thanos guarding the Odium factory.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_START_1,"Well, Peter, that fella was a snake. Seems par for the course to me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_START_2,"Good talk, Yondu. Good talk."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_END_0,BOOYAH!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_END_1,No more Odium for Ultimus! I bet he's gonna cry like a big blue baby.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_END_2,Fury's gonna love hearing about this...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_0,"Hey, Commander! Groot's gone missing. I'm rounding up a search party. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_1,I need to grab some S.T.R.I.K.E. guys for backup. Thanks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_2,"Last place he was seen was some backwater Ravager planet. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_3,I'm going to start there by roughing up some of the locals.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_START_0,ROCKET'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color>\n HITS A TARGET AND <color=#fff568>ALL ADJACENT TARGETS</color>.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_START_1,USE HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>ATTACK ALL</color> FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_0,"Hey, Ravager! WHERE'S GROOT?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_1,Your tree friend passed through here a while ago. Sounded like he was trying to make himself scarce.\nAnd fast.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_2,Then some crazy robot charged in and took off with him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_3,Ultron? What does Ultron want with Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_0,"OK, bucket of bolts. Hand over my friend, and no one gets their spark plugs pulled."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_1,"Your alien friend developed a rare fungus I plan on augmenting to my needs. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_2,"Fungus? Your wiring's messed up, Toaster Head. Groot's NOT sick."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_3,Negative. The fungus is highly contagious. It is why he went into seclusion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_4,"If Groot's sick, we've got to help him. Hand him over."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_5,Your threats are inconsequential.\nI tire of them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_6,Fine then. Disassembly time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_0,Where are you holding Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_1,"He is guarded by an army of my drones. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_2,You will never reach him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_3,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_0,What's this you say about Groot being sick?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_1,"The tree alien was hiding because he did not want to contaminate anyone. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_2,I intend to mutate the fungus to destroy humanity.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_3,"Not a fan of ANY of that! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_4,Now where is he?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_5,Guarded by my Ultron army. There is no way to save him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_6,I'm getting Groot. Even if I have to disassemble every single one of your tin can soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_0,"Groot, how could you just skip out like that? We're family!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_1,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_2,"I know you're sick, but we'll find a cure. Don't worry!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_3,"Rocket Raccoon, back away from Groot. The Kree cannot risk an outbreak. Groot must be eliminated."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_4,"Oh great, now you bozos had to show up and complicate things."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_5,"How about YOU back away, or I'll give you something to regret. I'm not abandoning Groot."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_0,"Step away from the infected alien. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_1,He must be exterminated for the safety of the galaxy.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_2,The infection cannot be allowed to spread.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_3,I'm gonna rip out those cybernetics and build a coffee maker out of them!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_START_0,ROCKET'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> DOES\nMAJOR DAMAGE TO A SINGLE TARGET.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_START_1,BUT BE CAREFUL.\nROCKET'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> ALSO GIVES GROOT TAUNT.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_FAIL_0,They took out Groot! No...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_0,"Well, they're down for the count. I think I've got an idea on where we can find you a cure."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_2,"It's risky, but that might work. I like it! I'll send a message and--"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_3,"This rotting tree has been judged as a threat to the Kree Empire. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_4,"Prepare for execution. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_5,"Take a number, pal.\nI got plenty of bullets. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_0,"Korath may have fallen for your tricks, but I will not."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_1,The Kree Empire has judged Groot's infection as an intergalactic threat.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_2,Not gonna happen. You gotta fight through us just like everybody else if you want a piece of him!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_3,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_START_0,GROOT'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> GIVES <color=#fff568>DEATHPROOF</color> TO HIMSELF AND HIS ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_START_1,USE GROOT'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> TO <color=#fff568>HEAL</color> AND <color=#fff568>CLEAR NEGATIVE EFFECTS</color> ON HIMSELF AND HIS ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_FAIL_0,Groot's down!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_0,"You fools, this tree's infection puts billions of lives at risk."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_1,We'll find a cure. I'm not giving up on him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_2,We will stop you. It's only a matter of time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_3,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_4,No. He's NOT right. We'll find another way.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_START_0,"This is A.I.M.'s formal requisition of the contaminated lifeform to study... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_START_1," ...with the intent of weaponizing the fungus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_FAIL_0,"Groot, no!!!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_END_0,"Commander, A.I.M. took Groot!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_END_1,They're going to experiment on him to weaponize the fungus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_END_2,They. Are. Going. To. Pay.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_0,"Hand over Groot, techno-geek."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_1,"This disease is magnificent. Once we weaponize it, it will make A.I.M. billions."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_2,So that's a no?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_3,Affirmative.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_4,Wait. Now I'm confused. You ARE going to hand him over?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_5,"Screw it. I'm just going to shoot you. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_END_0,"Groot, did they hurt you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_END_2,"I mean, except for the fact that you still have an infectious, life-threatening fungus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_0,"Hey Groot, I just accessed A.I.M.'s medical database."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_1,Seems like when they tried to weaponize this disease you got...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_2,...they also developed a cure as a fail-safe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_3,What do you say we blast our way to the lab and steal the cure?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_4,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_5,"Forty-two, actually. Why do you ask?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_START_0,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_END_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_END_1,"I guess we'll find out. Hopefully not too bad. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_0,"Just hand over the vaccine, and we'll be on our way."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_1,"A.I.M. will profit greatly from the weaponization of this infection. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_2,"Not if it means experimenting on my friend. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_4,"I agree, Groot. Time for a different approach."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_START_0,"WHEN GROOT IS ON YOUR SIDE, ROCKET'S\n<color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> HITS FOR EVEN MORE DAMAGE."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_0,"OK, buddy. Looks like the antidote is working. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_1,You feel anything yet?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_2,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_3,Oh yeah... I'm gettin' dizzy... This stuff really works!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_4,We better sleep this one off.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_5,I'm sure everything will be fine by the morn--
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_6,I... am... Groot...
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_0,"Scott, we've just received a distress call from resistance forces in the micro dimension."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_1,Ultimus has been abducting scientists en masse to work on some kind of mysterious project.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_2,"That's a bummer, but that world is controlled by corrupted forces. There's not a lot we can do about it."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_3,We're the ONLY ones that can do something about it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_4,"Scott, they need our help!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_5,"Alright Hope. If you think we can make a difference, count me in. Let's put a squad together."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_6,"No can do, Lang. Only you and Hope can return to that dimension."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_7,Our experimental Pym tech only worked when the planet was preserved in the orb's stasis field.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_8,"Wait, so we're gonna have to do this just the two of us?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_9,"Scott, we can do this. We HAVE to do this. After all..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_10,We're Wasp and the Ant-Man.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_11,"Ok, you got me. That was really cool. Let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_0,"Scott, how are your gauges holding up?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_1,Looking good. This should be a piece of cake.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_2,"At this size, compared to the bad guys we should be way over-powered."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_3,Here's hoping. Resistance intel suggests we take out this armory to disrupt their forced recruitment operations.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_4,Let's beat up some tiny Hydra dudes.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_0,"Ok, they still pack a punch, even at this size."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_1,Nothing we can't handle.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_2,Wanna go steal a Helicarrier?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_3,Heli-yes!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_START_0,If we can take control of this Helicarrier the resistance will gather momentum.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_START_1,"If you can defeat us, perhaps."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_START_2,Oh boy.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_0,"Man, I never thought I'd see the day I'd go back to my old heist days."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_1,It's for a good cause.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_2,You don't need to tell me that.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_3,"Cassie will understand, Scott. Let's keep going."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_INTRO_0,Resistance forces have confirmed the abducted scientists all specialized in working with technology similar to Pym Particles.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_INTRO_1,Good thing we're here!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_INTRO_2,The latest group of scientists was abducted in Little Tokyo. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_0,"Hey dirtbags, stop stealing scientists of Little Tokyo to do Ultimus's dirty work. Or else."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_1,"Or else, what?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_2,Or else... We'll stop you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_3,"Scott. Less words, more Ant-Man-ing."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_END_0,I get the feeling Ultimus has been alerted to our presence.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_END_1,We need to pick up the pace and find out what Ultimus is working on.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_START_0,"Wolvie, LOOK LOOK! Fresh meat for us to return back to Ultimus in a body bag!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_START_1,If they're lucky.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_START_2,Don't underestimate us. We've dealt with worse than you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_END_0,THAT was intense. Those guys never stood a chance.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_END_1,"Remind me to never piss you off, Hope."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_END_2,I'd go easy on you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_0,Where to next?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_1,There are rumors that this dimension's Kingpin is working on a plan to poison people with an airborne corruption bio-weapon.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_2,Who's giving you this intel? Your resistance contact?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_3,A little bird told me.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_4,Nice.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_0,"Fisk, we're shutting down this operation. It's over."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_1,How very nice of you to show up.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_2,Nothing brings me greater joy than eliminating pests.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_3,"You should find some better hobbies, man."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_END_0,Crisis averted!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_END_1,We still have the big fish to fry.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_END_2,Time to find out who's really pulling the strings on this planet for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_0,"Scott, remember how you enjoyed breaking into the Avengers headquarters?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_1,"You mean when I beat Falcon?\nYes, I remember."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_2,That was awesome.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_3,"Well, this time we need to break into the Pentagon."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_4,NO WAY.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_5,The mysterious leader of Ultimus's forces on micro Earth has a secret facility under the Pentagon.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_6,We need to sneak our way in to confront them.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_7,Time to get EVEN smaller.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_8,This is so cool...
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_0,"Okay, we're in. Security seemed a bit lax..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_1,Agreed. Something doesn't feel right.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_2,"Welcome, Ant-Man and The Wasp. Your quest to save this world ends here."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_3,That's... a lot of Nick Fury Life-Model Decoys... I think.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_0,You're too late. The Queen's plan cannot be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_1,Our captured scientists have already completed Ultimus's next great work.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_2,That doesn't sound good.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_3,"Come on, Scott. We're so close to ending this. The lab is up ahead."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_4,Time to find out who this Queen is.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_0,You.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_1,I don't know whether to be flattered or miffed that this planet's evil mastermind is my doppelganger.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_2,"I'd lean towards miffed. But it's a surprise, I'll give you that."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_3,"My Queen, Pym Particle enhanced Ultron production lines are operational."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_4,Your scientists have ensured the production lines will continue as long as you retain command.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_5,Thanks for telling us how to defeat you! Really appreciate it!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_0,We did it!  Tiny world is saved.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_1,Good thing Ultimus won't be able to use Pym Particle enhanced Ultron bots any time soon.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_2,That would have been super bad.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_3,Ready to return home?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_4,Let's do it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_5,"So long, Tiny World. It's been real."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_INTRO_0,"Scarlet Witch and Vision, form up. Ultimus's forces are inbound."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_INTRO_1,"Okay, we'll be... Arrghh! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_INTRO_2,Wanda? What's wrong?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_INTRO_3,It's the voices again... I can't get them out of my head!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_INTRO_4,"Vision, you're going to have to rally. Enemy forces incoming!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_START_0,"Looks like it's just you and me, Vision."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_START_1,We will hold them off while Wanda recovers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_MID_0,"Captain Rogers, your vital signs are reaching a critical level."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_MID_1,"I'll be fine, just... need to take a knee here for a minute..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_MID_2,"I'm here! Let me help, Cap."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_MID_3,USE SCARLET WITCH'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>REDISTRIBUTE</color> HEALTH AMONGST HER ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_MID_4,USE HER <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> TO PROLONG THE LENGTH OF <color=#fff568>NEGATIVE EFFECTS</color> ON <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color>.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_END_0,"Wanda, what happened to you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_END_1,I recently started hearing voices in my head. They're getting louder.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_END_2,We need to get you to a doctor.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_END_3,I'm not sure a medic can help with something like this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_01_END_4,"I'm thinking of another kind of doctor. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_0,"Wanda, we need these voices to take corporeal form if we are to dispel them. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_1,"You must open your third eye.\nNow focus on my voice... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_2,By the Mists of Morpheus...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_3,GAH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_4," --"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_5,What are you doing inside my mind? Are you a corrupted spirit?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_6,I am something different. I am the part of you transcending to become the Nexus Being.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_7,What does that mean?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_INTRO_8,You will soon find out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_START_0,"As the Nexus Being, the depths of your mind hold great strength."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_START_1,Prepare to face its power!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_END_0,"I saw... myself, but as something called the Nexus Being. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_02_END_1,There are tomes at the Sanctum Sanctorum that can tell us more.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_INTRO_0,"I've been doing research on the Nexus Being, and if the legend is true, the chosen person is to guard the Nexus of All Realities."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_INTRO_1,What is the Nexus of All Realities?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_INTRO_2,"A realm where one can manipulate all space and time. Access to that realm, which can only be found in our dimension, is what Ultimus seeks."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_INTRO_3,"As for why you were chosen to guard it, I'm not sure. We need to find out more."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_INTRO_4,"Mordo used to speak of the Nexus Being, and I believe the last one to hold the title was the Ancient One."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_INTRO_5,Mordo may hold the answers we seek.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_START_0,"Why have you come here, Strange?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_START_1,Relax. We only came to talk.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_START_2,"Talk? You speak only lies. Defend yourself, or be destroyed!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_END_0,Tell us what you know about the Nexus Being.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_END_1,The Ancient One was the last one.\nIt is the defender of the M'Kraan Crystal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_END_2,"My master told me that the crystal is the key to protecting the Nexus of All Realities. How exactly, is still a mystery to me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_END_3,You will likely find the crystal amongst the ruins of the planet Birj.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_END_4,Is it true she is the chosen one?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_03_END_5,We'll find out soon enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_INTRO_0,The M'Kraan Crystal seems to be in this temple on planet Birj.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_INTRO_1,How has it been kept safe here all this time?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_INTRO_2,Mordo warned us the entrance to the temple was heavily fortified by the Ancient One to ensure it would be safe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_INTRO_3,"If you truly are the Nexus Being, you will have the power necessary to clear the path to the crystal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_INTRO_4,Time to put my new powers to the test.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_START_0,Be gone. This temple is protected by the Nexus Being.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_START_1,"Lucky for you, I'm the Nexus Being. Let us pass?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_START_2,No. I cannot let you pass.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_END_0,The Ancient One will make this difficult for us. Even with you here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_04_END_1,"Yes, that seems clear now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_INTRO_0,What do you think the Ancient One placed inside to guard the temple?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_INTRO_1,Pocket dimensions filled with mystical spirits of immeasurable power.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_INTRO_2,Lovely.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_START_0,These are the manifestations of all our fears.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_START_1,"Wanda, stop this foolish quest.\nJoin me once more..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_END_0,You're also afraid of Hydra?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_05_END_1,"Not Hydra per se, but Red Skull. That face? Creepy stuff."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_INTRO_0,I still do not understand. Why was I chosen to be the Nexus Being?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_INTRO_1,Magic has a way of choosing the owner.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_INTRO_2,All we can do is embrace what comes our way.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_INTRO_3,Easy for you to say. You got a cape with a mind of its own.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_INTRO_4,"It's not always great. When I'm sleeping, if it's bored, it likes to hit me in the face."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_START_0,"You are a danger to everyone around you. Scarlet Witch, surrender now. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_START_1,"You are spirits, nothing more.\nYour words mean nothing to me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_END_0,"What will we find next, Strange?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_06_END_1,No idea. We're in uncharted territory here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_INTRO_0,Do we know what the M'Kraan Crystal has to do with the Nexus of All Realities?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_INTRO_1,My research never came across anything about the M'Kraan Crystal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_INTRO_2,"The Ancient One kept the crystal here for a reason though, so it must be important."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_INTRO_3,"If I truly am the Nexus Being, then we will find our answers upon finding the crystal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_START_0,"Greetings, Scarlet Witch. We are members of The Strange Society."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_START_1,Okay... Why are there so many of you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_START_2,We must prove you're the actual Nexus Being and not an imposter.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_END_0,So... What was that all about?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_07_END_1,I really have no idea.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_INTRO_0,We are close now to the M'Kraan Crystal. I can FEEL it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_INTRO_1,"Nexus Being, you have arrived just as the prophecy foretold."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_INTRO_2,You must now defeat the manifestations of all that you love.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_INTRO_3,"You must purge yourself from it, overcome it, transcend above mere human emotions."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_INTRO_4,Prepare for your\ngreatest challenge yet.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_START_0,I understand now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_START_1,Nothing is more important than this...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_END_0,You are worthy. Our last hope. The Nexus Being to protect the gateway in the crystal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_END_1,"Inside the crystal, many great powers exist, including the Nexus of All Realities."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_END_2,"And for THAT reason, we must keep the crystal from Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_08_END_3,We must DESTROY it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_INTRO_0,"Mordo, what is this?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_INTRO_1,Ultimus can never get the crystal.\nWe must destroy it!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_INTRO_2,"But if we destroy it, we don't know what will happen. It could destroy everything!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_INTRO_3,"A chance at freedom or certain doom at the hand of Ultimus?\nI choose freedom. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_START_0,"I will protect the M'Kraan Crystal and the Nexus within. You will fail, count on it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_START_1,Try as you must.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_0,Cali mon ta ren fooloo belaga...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_1,"Mordo, what have you done!?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_2,I have unbound the crystal from you and sent it across the cosmos!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_3,And you... I will send you to the nether realm. Far from the crystal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_4,I call upon the energy of the twelve moons of Munnopor...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_5,NO!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_6,Taun taun cham fon craw!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_7,"Mordo, you fool. Why must you always make a mess of things?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SW_09_END_8,I am the ONLY one with the will to do what must be done. I did what you could not.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_INTRO_0,"Alright, boy. Here's our big chance!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_INTRO_1,Hurrh?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_INTRO_2,The whole world is under attack from Ultimus and now we can do our part.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_INTRO_3,A horde of A.I.M. Monstrosities\nare making a big mess over\nby the Circle Q.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_INTRO_4,Let's go show 'em. This is Ms. Marvel's town. Nobody messes with Jersey City!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_INTRO_5,Hurrh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_START_0,"Hey, you! Get away from that convenience store!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_START_1,It's Embiggening time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_START_2,Use MS. MARVEL'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nto <color=#fff568>ATTACK ALL</color> and <color=#fff568>GENERATE ENERGY</color> for Hero Allies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_START_3,Use her <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> to <color=#fff568>HEAL HERSELF</color> for a large amount of health.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_MID_1_0,"Geez, there's no end to these guys."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_MID_1_1,"At this rate, I'm gonna have to eat like 50 gyros to recover..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_MID_2_0,"Hey, kid. Looks like you could use some support."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_MID_2_1,Avengers Assemble!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_END_0,I can't believe that just happened... Definitely going in my next fanfic.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_END_1,Hurrh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_END_2,"What's that, boy? You found something?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_01_END_3,Looks like a space rock? We should probably hold onto it for safekeeping.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_INTRO_0,"Hey, Quake. You told me to reach out to S.T.R.I.K.E. if I ever found any of those cosmic anomaly things in the area."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_INTRO_1,And?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_INTRO_2,I found one. Near Coles High School in Jersey City.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_INTRO_3,I'll send you a S.T.R.I.K.E. team to help investigate.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_INTRO_4,"As long as I get paid my finder's fee, works for me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_START_0,Huh. Some girl in cosplay is here fighting some aliens for the anomaly.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_START_1,"This isn't cosplay, I'm Ms. Marvel! Help me fight these bozos?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_START_2,"Sure, why not?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_START_3,MS. MARVEL'S <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> gives her <color=#fff568>TAUNT</color> when a <color=#fff568>HERO ALLY</color> drops below 50% health.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_START_4,MS. MARVEL pairs very well with <color=#fff568>HERO BRAWLER</color> teammates like <color=#fff568>SPIDER-MAN</color>. She gains <color=#fff568>ASSIST NOW</color> at a much higher rate and provides <color=#fff568>DEFLECT</color> to these teammates.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_END_0,"Woot! Take that, you chumps."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_END_1,"I'm here on behalf of S.T.R.I.K.E., yada yada, please hand over that crystal so I can secure it for them."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_END_2,"As long as it's in safe hands from the bad guys, I've got no problem with that. Go ahead, take it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_02_END_3,Can't. It's... stuck to you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_INTRO_0,Bizarro dog? Can you like zap this thing off of me maybe?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_INTRO_1,Hurrh-uh.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_INTRO_2,Crap. This is bad.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_INTRO_3,It's about to get worse. More corrupted forces incoming!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_START_0,"We have been sent to retrieve the anomaly. It belongs to Ultimus, by divine right."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_START_1,Ultimus has already cost Earth way too much... No way.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_END_0,What the heck is this crystal anyway?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_END_1,No idea. I was told to find it and bring it to them. So that's what I'm gonna do.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_03_END_2,"And since Ultimus wants it, it's a big deal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_INTRO_0,More Ultimus forces on the way. We need to find a vantage point to take them on.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_INTRO_1,"Lockjaw, any ideas?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_INTRO_2,Roof!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_INTRO_3,On that rooftop? Good idea.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_START_0,I wonder why this crystal is stuck to me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_START_1,"Kid, this is way above my pay grade. All I can do is help crack some skulls."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_START_2,And get you back safely... maybe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_END_0,"After this is over, wanna go grab a drink? I know a great bar just around the corner."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_END_1,I'm 16.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_04_END_2,Fair enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_INTRO_0,S.T.R.I.K.E. headquarters is not far from here. Still got more corrupted to deal with though.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_INTRO_1,Too bad Lockjaw can't just teleport us there. The crystal is messing with his abilities.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_INTRO_2,That giant dog can teleport?\nOf course it can.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_START_0,"Geez, this whole experience has been like that impossible level in Flibble Bobble!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_START_1,Another gamer. You and Quake are gonna get along great.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_START_2,Wait... do I get to meet Quake? She's a legend!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_END_0,"Alright, S.T.R.I.K.E. folks, special delivery."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_05_END_1,One multi-dimensional anomaly with bendy girl attached. You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INTRO_0,"Ms. Marvel, it appears you are the lucky new host for the M'Kraan Crystal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INTRO_1,Is that what this thing is?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INTRO_2,It is. And we need to find Scarlet Witch in order to unbind it from you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INTRO_3,"Okay, where is she?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INTRO_4,Banished to the nether realm by Baron Mordo. I'm still trying to find out where that is.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INTRO_5,Bummer.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_START_0,More of Ultimus's forces are after the crystal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_START_1,Protect me while I finish searching for Scarlet Witch. I'm close to finding her.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INFO_1_0,By the Mists of Munnopor...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INFO_2_0,By the Flames of the Faltine...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INFO_3_0,By the Fangs of Farallah...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_FAIL_0,"Uh oh, the wizard dude is down!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_END_0,"Ms. Marvel, quickly, go through the gateway. I can't hold it open for long. The crystal will find Scarlet Witch!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_END_1,"Holy moly, I'm going into another dimension. Wicked..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_06_END_2,Not alone you're not. You can't send this kid in by herself! We're coming with.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_INTRO_0,"So this is the nether realm, huh? Seems pretty creepy to me, boy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_INTRO_1,Hurrh.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_INTRO_2,All we gotta do is follow this M'Kraan Crystal thingy to wherever Scarlet Witch is.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_START_0,"Okay, these guys look pretty OP."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_START_1,The spirits of the nether realm hunger for your life force...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_START_2,Nope. Not gonna happen.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_END_0,Seems like the crystal starts vibrating when I point it in the right direction.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_07_END_1,"That's some solid game design! Well, magical object design, I guess."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_INTRO_0,This place smells like death.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_INTRO_1,Let's hurry it up and find this lady before this place devours us or something.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_INTRO_2,We're close. The crystal is making it pretty clear at this point.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_INTRO_3,Definitely glad I didn't touch that thing before you did. Gives me the heebie jeebies...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_START_0,The M'Kraan Crystal... I must have that power...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_START_1,I wouldn't eat it... I doubt that's Halal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_END_0,Something's wrong... The crystal is starting to pulse!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_08_END_1,Rrruh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_INTRO_0,Scarlet Witch is being attacked by spirits up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_INTRO_1,Let's go punch some ghosts.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_INTRO_2,"Besides, if she takes a dirt nap, we're stuck here for eternity, right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_INTRO_3,Yup.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_INTRO_4,That would be bad. I'm supposed to feed Trish's cat tomorrow.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_START_0,"Be gone, demons. I must return to the Nexus realm... The crystal needs me..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_START_1,"Scarlet Witch, we're here to help! M'Kraan Crystal says hi by the way."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_FAIL_0,Scarlet Witch is down! Now we'll never get out of here...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_END_0,"Thank you! I don't even know how long I've been here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_END_1,"With the power of the crystal near me, I can open a portal to return us home."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_END_2,"So, mission accomplished! Well, kind of. Do you know how to actually remove this thing?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_END_3,"Unfortunately, your guess is as good as mine. But I'm sure we can find a solution together."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MM_09_END_4,Together? We're gonna do a team-up? I love team-ups!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_0,Ready to get that M'Kraan Crystal off of you?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_1,"YES PLEASE. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_2,"Polymorphing it off doesn't work, and NOW it's starting to itch. Ugh."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_3,Intel indicates Scientist Supreme might be able to help.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_4,She's been gathering parts to build a device that specializes in nullifying magical objects.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_5,Then that's where we'll search first.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_START_0,Word on the street says you're looking to make a device that nullifies magical objects.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_START_1,True... But MY sources say you have a powerful crystal in your possession.\nHand it over.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_START_2,Not gonna happen.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_0,"Okay, fine, you win.\nCan't blame me for trying..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_1,"What the heck, lady! We came here for your help, and you tried to steal the crystal from us?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_2,"Look, Ultimus has the device you want."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_3,"My version is too early in prototyping to be of any use. It's embarrassing, really."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_4,"Why not just steal HIS version? I tried, believe me. Maybe you can succeed where I failed."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_0,So Ultimus has a device that can unstick this thing from me? Let's go get it then!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_1,"Quake, can you help us track down where Ultimus is keeping such a device?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_2,"Ladies, no time for that, I need you back here, pronto. The Helicarrier is under attack."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_3,Ugh. Again?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_START_0,"Surrender now, or we'll raid this ship in the name of Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_START_1,Whoa. We're being attacked by space pirates?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_START_2,It happens more often than you might think.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_END_0,"Ms. Marvel, are you feeling alright?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_END_1,I... don't know. This crystal is starting to make me feel... weird.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_0,What's happening to Ms. Marvel?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_1,"With the crystal bound to her, it's running into unforeseen complications."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_2,The healing factor in her Inhuman DNA is trying to feed off the energy in the M'Kraan Crystal. This is causing the crystal's temperature to rise.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_3,Wait. Am I gonna explode? I don't wanna explode!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_4,"Stay calm. We can figure this out. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_5,The good news is we've tracked down a possible location for Ultimus's device.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_6,Head to the docks. The device is in a shipment intended for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_START_0,There's the shipment. Let's take it off their hands.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_END_0,"Look, there's the device. We found it!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_END_1,"True, but we don't have the expertise to operate it and nullify the crystal."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_END_2,We need to bring this back to Scientist Supreme.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_0,"Okay, so all we gotta do is bring this device back to Scientist Supreme so she can fix me before I explode."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_1,No pressure...
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_2,"Halt, heathens. Surrender that crystal and the Unbinder to us now, and we will spare you."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_3,The Unbinder? Seriously? Who names these things?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_START_0,You guys should really quit while you're behind.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_START_1,You're going to walk away empty-handed.\nIf you're lucky.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_END_0,"Scientist Supreme, can you help us figure out how to activate this device?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_END_1,We need to get this crystal away from Ms. Marvel immediately.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_END_2,Of course! Let's take a closer look at it in my lab.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_0,Hmmm... It looks like this Unbinder is missing two key components. A Conjure Stone and a Cosmic Cube.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_1,A Conjure Stone... I know where to find one!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_2,Really? How?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_3,"Since becoming the Nexus Being, I've begun to hear voices calling me to mystic objects of power."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_4,"There is a Conjure Stone close to here, I can feel it. It's being held in a nuclear submarine base controlled by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_5,Cool! Let's go get it before this crystal makes me explode.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_START_0,"If you think you'll get this Conjure Stone without a fight, you are a fool."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_START_1,"Actually, I was planning to smack you with my giant hand and then yoink it from you."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_START_2,Sounds like we're on the same page.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_END_0,We've got the stone.\nOnly the Cosmic Cube remains.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_END_1,"That's good cuz... phew... Is it getting hot in here, or is it just me?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_END_2,This M'Kraan Crystal is starting to get CRAZY hot now.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_0,I am TOTES looking forward to taking a cold shower after all this is done with.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_1,I sense the presence of a Cosmic Cube nearby.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_2,Awesome! Where?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_3,I can hear it in that building. Looks like it's owned by something called Hope Yards--
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_4,Ohhhhh... HYDRA. I get it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_5,Looks like we have a SNAKE problem in Jersey City. Again.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_START_0,"Hand over the Cosmic Cube, and I promise not to have Captain America kick your butt in my next fanfic."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_START_1,You have taken a great risk to come here with the M'Kraan Crystal in your possession.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_START_2,It's time to teach you both a lesson in humility.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_0,Defeating me accomplishes NOTHING.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_1,"How so? We've got the Cosmic Cube, and you're down for the count."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_2,"The Cube is of little importance, child."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_3,The underground invasion of your pathetic city has already begun. You cannot stop it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_0,We have what we need to make the Unbinder work. Time to get that crystal off of you before it's too late.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_1,"I can't... not yet! This is MY city, and I can't stand by and watch Ultimus destroy it while I'm off saving my own skin."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_2,But the M'Kraan Crystal might kill you! I can't let that happen to you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_3,Help me stop this invasion first. Please.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_4," --"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_5,Very well. We can try. But we must get you back to Scientist Supreme immediately afterwards.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_6,YES! Let's do this!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_START_0,They've already got one of those portal thingies open down here! This is bad.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_START_1,"If we can fight them off, I can seal the portal from this side."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_0,"Activate the Unbinder, hurry!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_1,"Alright, hold still, my dear.\nThis... is going to sting. A lot."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_2,AGH!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_3,It's done.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_4,"Good news! The M'Kraan Crystal is cooling rapidly. It's all yours, Scarlet Witch."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_5,"Ms. Marvel, are you okay?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_6,"Yeah, I'm good. Thanks again for all the help."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_7,"You can call me Kamala, by the way."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_8,"I'm Wanda. Pleasure to meet you, Kamala."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_0,"Thanks to Nick Fury, we have tracked down nearly all the components necessary to resurrect the Supreme Intelligence."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_1,All the more concerning that he's gone missing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_2,What do you mean? Has Ultimus captured him again?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_3,Unknown. Last contact with Fury was behind enemy lines on planet Kallu.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_4,That area is way too hot for a S.T.R.I.K.E. team. We'd never make it in one piece.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_5,The Kree resistance will find him. Our minions can infiltrate enemy lines without risk of exposure.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_6,"It is our duty to track down Fury. Without him, the Supreme Intelligence cannot be brought back online."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_START_0,Fury landed here on Kallu. We must follow the trail to his last known location.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_START_1,After we rid this planet of these corrupted Ravagers...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_END_0,"Excellent work, team. Your reputations precede you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_END_1,Stop acting like you're running this squad just because you have a cape.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_0,Do we know yet where Fury's trail ends?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_1,Up ahead. Fury's tracks lead into that research facility on the ridge.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_2,Scans indicate a heavy presence of Hydra soldiers guarding the lab.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_3,Time to expel them from one of our worlds. Permanently.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_START_0,"Kree soldiers, you do not have the proper clearance to enter this facility."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_START_1,"Return to your assigned patrol duties, immediately."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_START_2,You dare give orders to a Kree? Prepare to taste our wrath.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_END_0,Do we know why Fury came to this facility?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_END_1,"It appears this facility was once run by one of our most-renowned scientists, Zara-Lar."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_END_2,Perhaps he believes she can help bring back the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_0,Those Hydra fools were so weak that we did not even need to use our Odium! Disappointing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_1,Your words strike true. We can only hope our future adversaries are worthy.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_2,Records in the lab indicate that Fury surrendered without a fight and was taken to a Kree Warship for processing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_3,That is odd. I would have expected him to fell a dozen Hydra scum before capture.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_4,We must assault one of Ultimus's Kree Warships in orbit to learn more.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_5,Details of Fury's current location will be found in the ship's receiving logs.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_START_0,Wait... You do NOT have the proper clearance codes to board this vessel!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_START_1,And you do not have the will to serve the true Kree Empire.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_START_2,Prepare for judgment.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_END_0,What do the ship's records say about Fury?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_END_1,He has been taken to Berhert. Ultimus has established a highly fortified prison there.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_END_2,Then to Berhert we shall go. Saving Fury gives us hope to revive the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_0,Do we have a path ahead to the prison mapped out?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_1,Scans indicate that Ultimus has stationed S.H.I.E.L.D. patrols throughout the area.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_2,He has S.H.I.E.L.D. forces out here?\nOn Berhert?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_3,Affirmative. This planet holds his maximum security prison. Retrieving Nick Fury from there will be difficult.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_START_0,A S.H.I.E.L.D. patrol has spotted us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_START_1,Not a concern. All I see are more heathens to reduce to ash.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_END_0,"Send word to Ronan. If we are to break Fury out of the prison, we need additional Kree support."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_END_1,Agreed. I believe there is an optimal choice for the task...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_0,The team's efforts thus far have been admirable.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_1,"You honor us, but we have more battles to win."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_2,Nick Fury's cell is heavily guarded by corrupted mercenaries in the prison.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_3,"To make matters worse, he is scheduled for conversion within hours."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_4,We cannot fight our way to his cell in time. I propose an alternative approach.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_5,Have Ard-Con pose as Ultimus to get us to Nick Fury's cell with minimal resistance.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_6,"Ard-Con, are you up to the task?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_7,"It is but one step on the road to my revenge. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_START_0,"Hi there, Ultimus. Would you kindly give me the secret password so I don't have to stab-shoot you for being an imposter?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_START_1,"The password is... ""step aside or I will rip you in half."""
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_START_2,"Incorrect. Prepare for the end, imposter!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_0,"Someone sounded the general alarm, and your eyes aren't glowing."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_1,I figure you're here to set me free.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_2,Indeed.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_3,Good to see y'all. Though we can't leave here just yet.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_4,You want to bring back the Supreme Intelligence? Can't do it without saving a Kree scientist named Zara-Lar.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_5,"Lucky for you, she's here in this prison."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_0,The whole reason I'm in this prison is because I was searching for Zara-Lar.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_1,The Kree scientist who is the final key to resurrecting the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_2,"When I discovered she'd been taken here, Ultimus's forces were closing in on me and I couldn't risk broadcasting the message to you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_3,So you let them capture you with the intent of confirming she was here?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_4,"Wreckless, but bold.\nYour reputation is well earned. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_5,I'm just glad you guys were able to track me down in time.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_6,Let's save Zara-Lar and get out of here before Ultimus gets wind of this.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_START_0,"Halt, prisoner! Fury's out of his cage. Contact the warden!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_START_1,"No time to mess around here, team. Put 'em down quickly so we can get Zara-Lar out."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_END_0,"Zara-Lar, we're here to free you. Ready to bring back the Supreme Intelligence?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_END_1,Backing up the Supreme Intelligence in case of catastrophe is my life's work.\nOf course.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_0,"It is quite impressive how much progress you've made in your efforts to resurrect the Supreme Intelligence, human."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_1,"Ultimus is our mutual enemy. We only defeat him as allies. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_2,"The data cores were impounded when I was captured. All of the components required are here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_3,I just need time to bring the system online and upload my primary boot sequence to reference the backup archives of the elders.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_4,"We've got your back, but Ultimus has to have gotten wind of our plans by now. Expect heavy resistance forces to intercept."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_START_0,You dare to revive this false Kree idol? Ultimus is the one and true god of all.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_START_1,"As protector of the Kree resistance, I vow to annihilate you and all corrupted in tribute."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_START_2,For the Kree!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_1_0,Preparing initial boot sequence of the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_2_0,All systems are green. Upload of archived elders activated.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_3_0,It's nearly done. Resurrection sequence initiated!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_FAIL_0,"We have failed, Zara-Lar. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_0,The Supreme Intelligence is back online! We've done it!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_1,Good. We finally have the tactical advantage we need to take down Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_2,Begin the process of searching for the optimal strategy to defeat him.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_3,Search initiated.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_4,"The Supreme Intelligence will remember what you've done, Nick Fury. Be sure of that."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_5,Here's hoping. I almost got converted looking for a way to help save it...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_6,Transfer the Supreme Intelligence to the Space Force destroyer.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_7,I will ensure that they safely reach my stronghold.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_0,"With the invasion of Ultimus, New York City and its surrounding areas are becoming overwhelmed."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_1,S.T.R.I.K.E. agents have been deployed and are doing their best...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_2,But we need to organize all our local heroes to keep the situation from spiraling out of control.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_3,"Night Nurse, that's where you come in."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_4,You have a pulse on what all of the area's local heroes are up to.\nTime to form up.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_5,Sounds like a plan. Spider-Man needs help stopping a chemical weapons hand-off over in Queens.\nThat's where we'll start.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_START_0,Spider-Man and a few S.T.R.I.K.E. rejects... Do you really think you can stop us?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_START_1,Don't underestimate us.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_END_0,"Thanks for the help! "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_END_1,Of course. Couldn't risk Ultimus's forces getting ahold of those chemical weapons from Dark Watch.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_END_2,Luke's got a situation going down in Harlem that we should help with. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_0,"Luke, brief us on the situation."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_1,Word on the street is there's a bad batch of Vibranium in a warehouse here in Harlem.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_2,What makes it so bad?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_3,The Vibranium is unstable and could be made into a large supply of lethal explosives.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_4,That's bad.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_5,We need to get to that shipment before corrupted forces can get their hands on it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_START_0,Haven't you brainwashed fools gotten the memo yet? Harlem is my town. Stay out.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_0,That's one less thing to worry about now. What's next?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_1,Punisher is planning to take out a Hydra squad intent on securing a cache of Judas rounds.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_2,"That would be great, but he's probably going to overdo it."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_3,Let's make sure he doesn't get out of control.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_0,Not interested in teaming up with you folks. I can handle this myself.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_1,"Punisher, we need to keep the collateral damage to a minimum. This city has suffered enough in this invasion."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_2,"Step aside, Cage. The special ammo they're transporting could hurt even you."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_3,"How about this? We help you here... you get to keep doing things ""your way"" in future fights against corrupted forces. How's that sound?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_5,Works for me. Just don't start whining if things get too rough for your tastes.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_6,"Maybe I should make you a web gun or something. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_START_0,Secure the ammunition quickly before the Punisher gets here!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_START_1,Too late.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_END_0,"Cache secured, Hydra scum crossed out. Win-win."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_END_1,Can't celebrate just yet. Daredevil needs our help in Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_0,Corrupted Hand forces have somehow gotten their hands on some Chitauri weapons.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_1,From the first invasion of New York by Loki? I thought S.H.I.E.L.D. had secured all of those.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_2,Not all of them. Folks pop up with them from time to time.\nRemember Vulture?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_3,"If we don't get those weapons, it's going to make securing New York impossible."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_START_0,"So, is it easier or harder to fight Ultimus's army for you?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_START_1,"Easier. Something about their corruption gives them a unique vibrational signature. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_START_2,"Bad vibes, huh? My Spidey-Sense is dialed in, too."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_END_0,That's the last of them. Time to regroup on the Helicarrier to figure out our next move.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_0,"Jessica, any luck tracking that corrupted Cosmic squad that's been roughing up Midtown?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_1,Zilch.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_2,I think they're using some kind of fancy alien tech to stay hidden.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_3,"They could have followed us back to the Helicarrier, and we wouldn't even know it."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_4,"Speaking of which... Spider-Sense tingling… Bad vibes, guys!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_5,Called it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_START_0,I am GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_START_1,Nope.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_END_0,I am so sick of fighting stupid aliens.\nThis is NOT what I signed up for.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_END_1,What DID you sign up for?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_END_2,Top-shelf booze. Fury promised me access to his personal supply.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_0,"Danny, how can we help you in the Upper West Side?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_1,Things are looking pretty bad right now.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_2,Ultimus has a team of corrupted mystics working on opening a dimensional gateway deep in the heart of the city.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_3,"Look, I'm not a wizard, magician, or whatever. What can I do to help?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_4,"Well, I discovered their super-secret weakness: really hard punches. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_5,"Okay, yeah, I can do that."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_START_0,You cannot stop the opening of this gateway. It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_START_1,I am the Immortal Iron Fist. You will fail. Count on it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_START_2,"Yeah, what he said!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_0,They have no chance of opening that portal now.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_1,"So, we win? Time for some R & R?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_2,We're not done yet. Ms. Marvel needs our help.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_3,The situation in Jersey City just went from bad to worse. We have to hurry!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_0,"Guys, I've been doing my best to keep them at bay, but they just keep coming."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_1,Who?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_2,Mutants... Inhumans...\nCorrupted ones. Lots of 'em.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_3,They've started to overrun Jersey City. I don't think I can do this on my own!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_4,"You don't have to, Ms. Marvel.\nWe're a team.\nWe're the City Heroes!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_5,"Nice speech, kid. Top shelf. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_START_0,This city belongs to Ultimus.\nSurrender now or be destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_START_1,Not gonna happen. I'm Ms. Marvel and this is MY city.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_MID_0,No! Ultimus even has corrupted versions of me? This is bad.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_MID_1,Don't sweat it. He's got evil versions of all of us...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_MID_2,That's somehow better?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_0,And stay out!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_1,You know what? I think this team has a bright future ahead of it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_2,If we manage to save the multiverse and all that...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_3,"Oh, we should give ourselves a name!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_4,"What, City Heroes of S.T.R.I.K.E. isn't good enough?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_5,Too wordy. East Side Avengers? Downtown Funk?\nKnights of New York?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_6,Don't forget Jersey City!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_7,"Oh, right. Hmmm... This is tougher than I thought."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, we've got a serious problem on our hands."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_1,"Our Mutant forces have made great strides against Ultimus in the multiverse, but we've had major setbacks of late."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_2,"Last I checked, S.T.R.I.K.E.'s Mutant squads were doing just fine.\nWhat happened?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_3,The Legacy Virus... it was custom made to target Mutants. We don't know where Ultimus got it. Its effects have been devastating.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_4,"To make matters worse, Ultimus has finally discovered a gateway to Limbo, the headquarters of our Mutant S.T.R.I.K.E. operations."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_5,"If his forces get inside, there will be nothing left to protect the Mutants from the Legacy Virus wiping them out completely."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_6,We need to send reinforcements to intercept before Ultimus can completely break down the mystical barrier I've erected there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_7,"Logan, go with Strange and take Cable with you to provide support."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_8,Looks like Storm is out there on her own until you can get there. Cyclops and the rest of our Mutant forces are stuck in Dimension 482-X7.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_INTRO_9,She's out there alone!? That virus is going to eat her alive. We need to move fast.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_START_0,"Surrender now, and we will offer you a quick and painless death."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_START_1,Your cheap threats mean nothing to me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_START_2,Prepare yourselves for oblivion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_START_3,Storm's <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> gains <color=#fff568>CHARGE</color> and becomes an <color=#fff568>AREA OF EFFECT</color> attack when charged.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_START_4,Storm's <color=#fff568>SPECIAL</color>and <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE </color> abilities become more powerful with each <color=#fff568>CHARGE</color> generated.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_START_5,"With at least <color=#fff568>8 CHARGES</color>, Storm's <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ATTACK</color> does massive damage to all enemies!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_MID_0,"Looks like you could use a hand, Ororo."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_MID_1,We'll hold them off. Just do your thing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_END_0,"Thank you for the support.\nHowever, I fear you may be too late."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_END_1,Scans confirm you're now infected with the Legacy Virus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_END_2,"In the future, this had already been cured. There must be a way to stop it, but for now we need to move."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_01_END_3,I can seal off Ultimus's portal to this plane. Go now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_0,"If I am infected by the Legacy Virus, does that put the rest of the team at risk?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_1,"Negative. Wolverine and Deadpool are safe because of their rapid healing factor, and I was vaccinated for this strain in my timeline."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_2,"In my future, we discovered the cure in another dimension. Inoculation was standard procedure."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_3,So the cure might exist in that dimension today?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_4,"Possibly. Keep in mind, my future no longer exists. The invasion of Ultimus has changed everything forever."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_5,But that dimension is our best bet. Especially considering the fact that you're already infected.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_INTRO_6,Only one way to find out. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_START_0,Ultimus has sent us new warriors to destroy. Today is a good day!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_START_1,Agreed. Patrol duty is a drag when I don't get to shoot a moving target.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_END_0,We're too late. Ultimus has already conquered this dimension and left nothing but ruins in his wake.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_02_END_1,The formula for the cure could still be here. We have to try.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_INTRO_0,My scans indicate there are code fragments linked to the Legacy Virus cure inside this bunker.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_INTRO_1,"If I can get to the mainframe, I may be able to recover the formula. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_INTRO_2,Lookin' forward to making the First Legion bleed again.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_START_0,We've got a breach in Sector 7-G.\nTake them out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_START_1,We need to take these guys out quickly to get to the mainframe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_END_0,"That's the last of them for now, but more will come. There are always more."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_END_1,Hacking into the mainframe. Stand by.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_03_END_2,Confirmed. I've pieced the formula back together. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_INTRO_0,"We now have the formula needed to generate a cure, but our window of time is short. We're counting hours here, not weeks. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_INTRO_1,What do we need?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_INTRO_2,"A sample of the virus, a rare batch of plasmids, and a set of Pym Technologies nanites programmed to target the virus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_INTRO_3,"Well, I have the virus for you.\nWhat about the rest?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_INTRO_4,I've tracked down a likely location for the plasmids we need. It's in an Ultimus-controlled armory in another conquered dimension.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_INTRO_5,Then that is where we shall begin our search.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_START_0,"Rocket, what should we do with these intruders?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_START_1,"Blast 'em, obviously."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_END_0,"The modified plasmids are locked away in this armory. Hang in there, Storm."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_04_END_1,I won't give up. Anything to save our people.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_INTRO_0,Scans indicate a heavy presence of corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers inside the armory.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_INTRO_1,Ultimus must realize the importance of these plasmids in being able to cure the Legacy Virus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_INTRO_2,"Can't say I'm happy about the idea of taking down Fury's crew, but there ain't nothin' we can do about it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_INTRO_3,This entire war is banking on us making the cure so all Mutants can help in this fight more effectively.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_INTRO_4,Time to show Ultimus the error of his ways.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_START_0,"Stand down. Hand us the plasmids, and you will be spared."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_START_1,"You think you scare us? You're not looking so good there, Mutant..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_START_2,Enough talking.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_END_0,"Plasmids secured. Once we have the Pym Technologies nanites, we can generate the cure to the Legacy Virus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_END_1,How much time do I have left?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_END_2,Not much. A few hours at most before the virus puts you down for good.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_END_3,"Wasp, do you have the nanites we need to keep Ororo from pushing daisies?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_END_4,"Sadly, no. They were stolen months ago by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_05_END_5,"Thankfully, I DO know where to find them."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_0,"Months back, Ultimus sent one of my corrupted doppelgangers to infiltrate one of my labs and steal the nanites."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_1,"I had a tracking device on the box containing the nanites, and I can confirm the stash is being stored in a corrupted lab nearby."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_2,"We've been using the tracker to gain intel on their operations. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_3,"Good, we can take out two birds with one stone. Grab the nanites, then I can generate the cure in the lab for Storm."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_4,"I will help create a path for you to get inside. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_5,You sure you're up for this?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_INTRO_6,"Even if you run out of time to make the cure for me, it will still be made in time for the rest of our people. I will make sure of that."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_START_0,"Hey, you aren't authorized to enter this facility! Deadpool, take them out, chop chop!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_START_1,With pleasure!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_END_0,We're close now... I can feel it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_06_END_1,"Hold on, Ororo.\nWe're one step closer to the cure."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_INTRO_0,The nanites are being held in storage here in the warehouse.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_INTRO_1,Reinforcements incoming!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_INTRO_2,Let them come. We shall see if they can handle a little rain...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_INTRO_3,And 300 kilovolts of lightning.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_START_0,"You're after the nanites? Oooooh, you're trying to make a cure for the Legacy Virus. How interesting!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_START_1,"Step aside, or you're getting a crash course in meteorology. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_07_END_0,"Nanites secured. We need to get to the lab, quickly. We only have minutes left before the virus takes down Storm."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INTRO_0,It will take me a few minutes to synthesize the cure.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INTRO_1,I'll coordinate from the lab while our S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator activates the centrifuges in the needed sequence.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INTRO_2,We'll give you the time you need.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INTRO_3,Even if I fall... You will make that cure. You must!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_START_0,"Fools, can you not see? Making a cure for the Legacy Virus is meaningless. You will never make it out of this facility alive."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_START_1,"I may not survive, but others will... Mutants have survived worse than the likes of you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INFO_1_0,Activating primary centrifuge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INFO_2_0,Sequencing is progressing optimally. Halfway there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INFO_3_0,"Secondary centrifuge activated. Hang on, Storm!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_FAIL_0,Our operator is down. We can't do this without her.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_0,Sequencing complete. We've got a full batch of the cure ready to go here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_1,"Ororo, take this quickly."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_2,"Thank you, Logan."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_3,I can feel the effects of it working already. My full strength will return in time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_4,Others have been afflicted for longer than I. We must get the cure to them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_5,<color=#fff568>MEANWHILE... UP IN ORBIT</color>
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_6,Have my forces done their job and kept the nanites from S.T.R.I.K.E. as instructed?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_7,"Negative, sir. They fought valiantly, but they could not stop them. Storm was too much for them to handle."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_8,A pity. Begin the orbital bombardment of the facility immediately.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_08_END_9,We will make sure they do not escape with their lives.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_INTRO_0,"Good hustle, people. We barely made it out of there."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_INTRO_1,"That orbital bombardment would have taken us out, no question."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_INTRO_2,"Team, what's your status?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_INTRO_3,Just caught a little shrapnel.\nI've had worse. Storm?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_INTRO_4,"I'm fine, but no time for chitchat."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_INTRO_5,It appears that Ultimus has sent in a crew to clean up the mess. Be ready.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_START_0,Focus your attacks on Fury when you can. He's controlling his team via a subdermal implant.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_START_1,If he goes down... They all go down.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_0,Hmmm... This Nick Fury was an LMD with a cyberlink far more advanced than anything I've seen in the present day.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_1,"It looks like Kree cybertech integrated with something a lot more familiar. If Ultimus has forces using this tech, that's a bad sign."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_2,A mystery for another time. Now we must hurry and distribute the cure to our Mutant forces throughout the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_3,"Ororo, does this mean we're ready to bring the rest of the team back to Earth?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_4,"Soon, Logan."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_5,We first need to get this cure to the bulk of our forces in Dimension 482-X7.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_6,Cyclops will want to focus on getting the cure to everyone before we risk returning to an Earth infected by the Legacy Virus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_7,Of course he will.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ST_09_END_8,"As for what Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants will want to do, I imagine they might have a more... aggressive plan in mind."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_MEDIC_0,Looks like you need some medical attention. I'm calling in backup.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_START_0,Kingpin is working with alien forces to abduct heroes and transport them in stasis orbs. You need to get to his warehouse before it's too late.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_ELEKTRA_0,Kingpin said you might come looking for him. Your search ends here.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_LUKE_0,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_NICKFURY_0,Now take out these mercs and get to Kingpin.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_0,So when do we get to find out what S.T.R.I.K.E. is about and what's going on here?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_1,"That's on a ""need to know"" basis, Spider-Man. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_2,All you currently need to know is that you need to stop Kingpin and recover those orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_3,"Geez. If I didn't ""need to know,"" I wouldn't have asked."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_START_0,The Kingpin ordered me to take you in. You're next on his list.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_0,"So Kingpin is trapping heroes in interdimensional orbs for some mysterious alien? "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_1,And Fury recruited us to stop him.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_2,That's all we know?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_3,Have you MET Nick Fury? I'm surprised he told us THAT much.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_START_0,This is where Kingpin is keeping those interdimensional orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_START_1,How did Fisk get his hands on alien tech like this?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_KINGPIN_0,Fools. I'm a part of something much bigger now.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_KINGPIN_1,Didn't know you could get any bigger...
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_0,Good job stopping Kingpin. It will take us months to get enough power cores to open all these orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_1,And there are heroes trapped in ALL of these orbs?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_2,We'll have to open them to know for sure.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_3,"I let one of the trucks escape so we can follow it to the source. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_4,That's your next objective.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_0,We traced the truck back to a covert Hydra base in the mountains.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_1,HYDRA? The scary world domination guys? What have they got to do with this?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_2,"That's what we need to find out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_3,Get in there and find out what Hydra is doing with those orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_INTRO_0,Kingpin and Hydra are abducting heroes and trapping them in orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_INTRO_1,But what is Hydra doing with the orbs once they're here?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_INTRO_2,I get the feeling we're about to find out.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_CROSSBONES_0,"Great. More heroes for the boss. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_CROSSBONES_1,"Didn't even have to go out and abduct you guys. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_INTRO_0,All the orbs are being moved to the center of the base.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_INTRO_1,That must be where we'll find our answers.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_WINTERSOLDIER_0,You're too late. This portal is already fully active.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_WINTERSOLDIER_1,Wait. Did he say portal?
ID_DIALOG_NUE_OBJECTIVE_MISSION_0,"In this mission, you have a special objective."
ID_DIALOG_NUE_OBJECTIVE_MISSION_1,Take out the HYDRA OPERATOR before he activates the orb stasis device.
ID_DIALOG_NUE_OBJECTIVE_MISSION_2,Then take out the rest of the mercenaries.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_1_0,1 of 4 stages activated.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_2_0,2 of 4 stages activated.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_3_0,3 of 4 stages activated.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_DONE_0,"The device has been activated. Mission failed. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_END_0,Interdimensional orbs. Genetically engineered soldiers. I picked a bad day to ditch school and join S.T.R.I.K.E.!
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_0,Colonel Fury says you need some firepower.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_1,"So he called you? Things are worse than I thought. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_2,I'm here to do whatever it takes to complete the mission.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_3,"That's what I'm afraid of. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_START_0,You will not stop Hydra and its new allies from converting this world.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_END_0,Hydra is sending the orbs through an interdimensional portal. We need to shut it down.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_0,Those Hydra Operators are sending the orbs through that interdimensional portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_1,I got this. The rest of you move out of the way.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_2,"Punisher, we need to work as a team if we're going to get this done."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_3,"Fine, Cage. How do you want to do this?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_4,We take down the <color=#fff568>OPERATORS</color> first to stop them from sending the orbs through.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_5,"You can take the lead on this one, Cage. But if things go sideways..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_6,I'm doing it my way.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_0,The Hydra Operators are sending the orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_1,We need to stop them before they send all the orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_2,"THIS MISSION HAS A SPECIAL OBJECTIVE. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_3,TAKE OUT THE HYDRA OPERATORS BEFORE THEY GET TO STAGE 4.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_1_0,The Hydra Operators have sent the first orb through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_2_0,They've sent half the orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_3_0,They've sent another orb through the portal!
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_DONE_0,We didn't take out the OPERATORS in time. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_END_0,"We stopped Hydra from sending those orbs through the portal. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_END_1,"But I get the feeling this fight is far from over. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_END_2,"Guys, my Spidey-Sense is going off the charts. Something BIG is heading this way. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_INTRO_0,What now?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_INTRO_1,Now we take down these weird blue guys guarding this portal and destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_INTRO_2,You make it sound so easy.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_START_0,What's the deal with these blue aliens guarding the portal?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_START_1,Don't care. As long as they go down when I shoot them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_HULK_0,Hulk SMASH!
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_HULK_1,"Uh, guys? What's the Hulk doing on the wrong side of the ""good guy"" line?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_0,"What was up with that weaker, but equally scary, Hulk attacking us?!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_1,That was NOT the Hulk from our dimension. He was a corrupted version from an alternate dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_2,Who in the what now?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_3,Get back to base. It's time I told you the true purpose of S.T.R.I.K.E. and what we're dealing with.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_4,"I guess that means we finally ""need to know."""
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_0,I created S.T.R.I.K.E. to deal with interdimensional threats...
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_1,The kind of stuff even S.H.I.E.L.D. or the Avengers are not equipped to deal with.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_2,So I'm assuming this qualifies?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_3,"Definitely. Interdimensional portals are opening up all over the world. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_4,Corrupted versions of Earth's most powerful and dangerous people are pouring out through them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_5,And we're the only ones who can stop them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_START_0,Can't we all just get along?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_START_1,These are NOT heroes from our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_START_2,They are corrupted versions from alternate dimensions. Take them down.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_MID_0,Soon you will all bow to the new king.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_0,I'm in communication with Nick Furys from other dimensions.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_1,Many warned me about this interdimensional threat before losing contact.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_2,I had hoped they would never find our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_3,What's so special about our dimension?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_4,"Most dimensions only connect to one or two others. But ours is unique. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_5,"It's a Nexus between dimensions... a gateway to countless other Earths. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_6,"If this dimension falls, the invaders will have access to thousands of other dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_0,"Aww, Iron Man? They corrupted you, too?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_1,"Not corrupted, Parker. Liberated."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_2,We have all been united for one singular purpose. You're next.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_3,"Gonna have to pass on that offer, Mr. Stark. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_4,"Kinda enjoying the whole ""free will"" thing."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_MORE_0,There's more of you?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_MORE_1,"We got a whole army of Iron Mans from other dimensions. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_MORE_2,You really ARE full of yourself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_0,A group of corrupted Rocket Raccoons is running rampant through the city.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_1,Hold up. Are you saying there are multiple versions of those jet pack rats?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_2,Yes. They've conquered hundreds of dimensions before coming here.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_3,"And each one has the flying, talking squirrel in it?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_4,Yes. They're also weapons experts. Exercise caution.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_START_0,Hey! Who let the trash pandas out of their cages?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_START_1,What did you call us?!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_END_0,So do we call animal control or what?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_0,"The Commander is sending us to infiltrate this base and kidnap Ronan, one of the Kree generals leading the invasion."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_1,What's the point in kidnapping one of these guys?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_2,We need to know what their plan is. Ronan has the intel we need.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_3,I bet I can make him talk.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_4,"That's not how S.T.R.I.K.E. operates, Punisher. We hold ourselves to a higher standard. "
ID_DIALOG_NUE_TIMED_MISSION_0,This is a TIMED mission. Take out the guards before time runs out.
ID_DIALOG_TIMER_LOSE_0,Fall back. We ran out of time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_0,"The big blue alien with the hammer is Ronan, the one we need to take down and bring back to base."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_1,"He looks pretty tough. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_2,"If this mission was easy, Fury wouldn't have sent S.T.R.I.K.E., right?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_3,"Fair enough. Let's do this. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_0,"If you think you can defeat Ronan the Accuser, you are sorely mistaken."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_1,We don't want to defeat you...
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_2,"We just want to kidnap and interrogate you. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_3,"THIS MISSION HAS A <color=#fff568>SPECIAL OBJECTIVE</color>. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_4,YOU MUST ONLY ELIMINATE <color=#fff568>RONAN</color> TO WIN THE MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_TIMER_0,"This is a TIMED mission. Take out RONAN before time runs out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_TIMER_REMINDER_0,We only need to take down Ronan. But we have to hurry.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_TIMER_LOSE_0,We took too much time. We need to fall back.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_END_0,We've got Ronan. Let's get out of here before reinforcements arrive.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_INTRO_0,We've got to get this Ronan guy back to base before he wakes up.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_INTRO_1,I've called for an extraction pod. We just need to hold out until it arrives.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_OPDEAD_0,The S.H.I.E.L.D. OPERATOR is down. She was our ride out of here!
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_1_0,The extraction pod has been called in.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_1_1,1 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_2_0,The pod is zeroing in on our coordinates.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_2_1,2 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_DONE_0,Prepare for extraction.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_DONE_1,3 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_0,You're going to tell us everything we want to know about this invasion plan.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_1,You will find out nothing from me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_2,"Widow, prep the psychics. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_3,"Yes, sir."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_4,"We'll find out what Ronan knows, one way or another."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_0,"Colonel, we're receiving a broadcast on a restricted channel."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_1,"It's also being sent to every major intelligence agency and criminal organization in the world. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_2,On screen.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_3,"Leaders of this dimension. I am Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_4,"I have come to accept your unconditional surrender. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_5,"In the dimension I come from, you have all already joined my cause."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_6,"And on every Earth I conquer, it plays out the same way."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_7,"Some of you will join me. Others will resist. But eventually... "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_8,ALL WILL SUBMIT TO MY WILL.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_9,And to the leaders of S.T.R.I.K.E. who have already begun to meddle in my plans. Know this...
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_10,You will be the first to fall.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_11,"Sir, detecting multiple enemies closing in on the Helicarrier!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_12,Battle stations!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_START_0,"Never thought I'd say this, but..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_START_1,We've come to get our Ronan back.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_START_2,So they extracted your free will but left your sense of humor intact?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_INTRO_0,Another wave of Ultimus's forces just breached the Helicarrier!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_INTRO_1,"They really want this Ronan guy back. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_INTRO_2,Which means we can't let them have him.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_REDSKULL_0,Hail Hydra! For Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_INTRO_0,"Sir, a squad of Ultimus's forces has infiltrated the Helicarrier."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_INTRO_1,"Get them off this ship. Once we're clear, I'll engage the cloaking device."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_INTRO_2,"Yes, sir."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_START_0,"Release Ronan now, and Ultimus might spare you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_MID_0,Now you face the full power of the Hand.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_END_0,The Helicarrier is secure. And the psychics were able to break through Ronan's mind.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_END_1,Good. Cloaking engaged. That should buy us some time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_END_2,"Now let's see what Ronan's hiding. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_0,Tapping into Ronan's mind revealed a lot about Ultimus's invasion plan.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_1,"For starters, it appears he uses the last dimension he conquers as a staging area for his next assault."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_2,So finding a way into that dimension could be the key to stopping the invasion?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_3,"Which means we need to build our own interdimensional portal. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_4,And you want me to steal the components from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_5,I'm on it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_6,What's the point of keeping psychics around when she reads minds like that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_START_0,Expect the base to be heavily guarded by corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_START_1,Like these.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INTRO_0,You'll need to cover me while I extract the schematics we need to build the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INTRO_1,You got it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_START_0,Cover me while I access the database for the schematics.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_1_0,The schematics are being accessed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_2_0,Halfway through uploading the schematics.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_3_0,Schematics almost uploaded.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_DONE_0,Upload complete. Preparing for evacuation.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_FAIL_0,They've taken out Black Widow. Abort...
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_0,"Can't let you leave with those schematics, Natasha."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_1,"Cap, isn't there still a small piece of you that knows you're on the wrong side?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_2,"There are no sides here, Black Widow. Just those loyal to Ultimus..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_3,... and those who will be.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_START_0,Clear the area so the extraction pod can land.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_END_0,Transport is en route. Evacuation commencing.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_0,We've analyzed the schematics to build our own portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_1,"Unfortunately, we're going to need a hyper-advanced artificial intelligence processor to operate it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_2,Where are we going to get something like that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_3,We're going to steal it. From an Ultron factory.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_4,"The robot? That took on ALL of the Avengers at once? And almost won? "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_5,We'll be in and out before they even know we were there.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_6,"Yeah. 'Cause that's what happens ALL the time. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_START_0,We'll need to get past these Ultron sentries to get into the base.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_INTRO_0,The Ultron mainframe should be up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_INTRO_1,"Good. The sooner we get out of this killer robot factory, the happier I'll be."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_START_0,INTRUDER ALERT!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_START_1,We better get past these sentries quick before the whole base is alerted.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_0,Be prepared for a fight.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_1,Ultron is not likely to just hand over his central processor.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_2,"You said we'd be in and out! ""They probably won't even know we're here,"" you said."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_3,I lied.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_ULTRON_0,Did you think I wouldn't notice you little pests scurrying around my home?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_END_0,Let's get this back to the Helicarrier. We have a portal to build.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_0,Elektra says the Hand Ninja Clan might possess a mystical artifact we could use to power the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_1,We need to infiltrate their fortress and steal it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_2,Not a fan of ninjas.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_3,"Pretty sure they're not a fan of you either, Punisher."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_NOBU_0,"You seek the artifact, but will only find death here."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_END_0,"With this artifact, we now have everything we need to build the portal."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_INTRO_0,"The portal is almost complete, but Ultimus's forces are onto us."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_INTRO_1,Hold them off until construction is complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_INTRO_2,My pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_START_0,We need to hold them off until the portal is complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_0,Cover me while I power up the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_1,Then what?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_2,Then you and the team go through and gather intel behind enemy lines.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_3,What about you?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_4,I need to stay on this side and keep the portal open as long as I can.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_5,But they'll overrun you!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_6,"Kid, I'm not even going to bother with the whole ""for the greater good"" speech. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_7,Just cover me until this damn thing is open.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_1_0,Initiating portal activation.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_2_0,Establishing transdimensional link.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_3_0,Hold on a little longer... almost got it...
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_DONE_0,The portal is open. Quick! Go through!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_FAIL_0,We're too late. We couldn't open the portal in time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_0,The portal is open. Go through. Now!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_1,"We're not leaving without you, Fury."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_2,"That's an order, soldier."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_3,There's no way you can take them on yourself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_4,I can handle myself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_5,"Besides, if you don't find a way to defeat Ultimus in that dimension..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_6,None of this will matter.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_7,Now GO.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_0,"This entire dimension has been conquered by Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_1,So why are we here exactly?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_2,The best place to acquire intel about your enemy is behind enemy lines.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_3,Also a great place to get killed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_START_0,Make sure we're not detected by any Ravager patrols.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_START_1,Like this one?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_LOSE_TIMER_0,They've called for reinforcements. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_0,Quick! We have to take them out before they call for backup.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_1,"Captain America? This isn't some sort of trick, is it? "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_2,I don't think I can stand having another one of my heroes go evil on me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_3,"I'm not controlled by Ultimus, Spider-Man. Now let's get to work."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_0,How are you still fighting Ultimus in this dimension?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_1,Our Bruce Banner developed a vaccine to Ultimus's Conversion Engine just before the entire dimension fell to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_2,"Let me guess: There was just one dose. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_3,"Yep. He insisted I take it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_4,Any chance we can recreate the formula?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_5,Maybe. But it would require infiltrating a high-security Kree laboratory.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_6,I was SO hoping you weren't going to say that.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_0,This Kree laboratory has the tech we need to reverse engineer a vaccine from my blood.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_1,All we have to do is fight our way through an army of enhanced Ultimus-controlled heroes.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_2,"Hook me up to the lab, extract the vaccine, and fight our way out."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_3,"Well, when you put it like that..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_START_0,The lab is just a little farther. We'll have to take down these guards first.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>CAPTAIN AMERICA</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_END_0,Let's get me hooked up to that lab and extract the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_0,"I'm going in the machine. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_1,Your S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator should be able to extract enough material to reverse engineer a vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_2,What are the chances this works?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_3,About 4%.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_4,Best odds I've had in years. Let's do it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_START_0,You'll have to watch over the S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator while I'm in the tank.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_1_0,Accessing Super-Soldier DNA.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_2_0,Administering sedative prior to extraction.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_3_0,Extracting vaccine tracers. Just one more step...
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_DONE_0,Vaccine extracted! We're done.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_INTRO_0,Ultimus's Thor Corps patrols this area. We have to be careful.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_INTRO_1,Thor Corps? Like an army of Thors? Seriously?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_0,"We'll have to defeat the Thor Corps if you want to make it back to your dimension with the vaccine. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_1,"Surrender now and accept your fate. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_2,Cap's still pretty weak. We'll have to protect him until he recovers.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_3,PROTECT <color=#fff568>CAPTAIN AMERICA</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_CAP_DEAD_0,Cap's been taken out!
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_INTRO_0,"Ultimus's own version of the Defenders, the Annihilators, are tracking us. We need to get away fast."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_START_0,"Annihilators, looks like we've tracked down our prey."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_START_1,Now comes the fun part.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_START_2,Talk is cheap. Let's fast forward to the part where we crack some skulls.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_0,Ultimus has begun his invasion of your dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_1,He's moving his fleet of ships through massive portals into your Earth.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_2,This is your only chance to get back to your Earth with the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_3,Great! Anywhere we can buy a ticket to get on one of those battleships?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_4,"We'll need to take out a Kree patrol and ""borrow"" their IDs to board the ship."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_START_0,Here's our chance. Take out this patrol so you can use their identities to get on board the battleship.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_0,The fleet is taking off. It's now or never. Better get going.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_1,What about you? Aren't you coming with us?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_2,"This is my home. Even if it has already fallen to Ultimus, I can't leave it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_3,Go save your world. Stop Ultimus. I'll keep up the fight here until you return.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_7_INTRO_0,We need to clear out this hold and hide out until the warship returns to our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_8_INTRO_0,I think I hear somebody coming.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_8_INTRO_1,"Well, we gotta take 'em out. Can't risk alerting the Kree crew."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_8_START_0,Stowaways! How dare you sully the sacred fleet of Ultimus with your unworthy presence.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_0,Great. We made it back to our dimension. Now what?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_1,Now we fight our way off this tin can and get the vaccine to Fury.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_2,"Actually, that sounds like a pretty good plan."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_3,I have my moments.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_START_0,Sweet! Target practice. Been a while since we've blasted us some rebels.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_START_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_START_2,"Groot says, ""You're not getting off this ship alive."""
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_0,Looks like the invasion is in full effect back here at home.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_1,"We need to get this vaccine to Fury. He'll know what to do with it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_2,Just one problem with that...
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_3,Director Fury has been captured by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_0,"Director, we are receiving a recorded distress call from the Captain America of the Fallen Dimension we visited."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_1,On screen.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_2,"To the leaders of S.T.R.I.K.E. from the Nexus Dimension, I've got some good news."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_3,Our Bruce Banner was injected with a partial vaccination to Ultimus's conversion process when he was abducted.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_4,"He has been on the run from Ultimus for the past few years, struggling to maintain his sanity. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_5,"If you send a team to this dimension to help track him down, we could complete the vaccination."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_6,This might be our best and last chance at a real cure for the corruption process--
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_7,--IF we can find this Hulk before Ultimus's kill squad does.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_8,"Stark, you up for a little interdimensional journey?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_9,My suit is already packed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_10,Figuratively. Of course.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_0,"Thanks for coming, Tony. I hope it's worth it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_1,Anything to help an old friend... from a different dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_2,I gave your S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator our Bruce Banner's unique gamma radiation signature.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_3,"Our only chance is to pinpoint his location before Ultimus's forces find him. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_4,AND here they come now.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_1_0,Pinpointing Hulk's location... Target within a 1 km radius...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_2_0,Target within 500 meters...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_3_0,Target traced to within a 100-meter location.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_DONE_0,We've found him! He's inside that warehouse up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_FAIL_0,They took out our operator! Abort...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_0,"Bruce! It's me, Cap. Your friend. You with us, buddy?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_1,Steve! You found me! I'm fighting this... as best I can... but... it's very... agh...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_2,GRARGH!!! MY ULTRONS! DO AS I COMMAND! SMASH THEM!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_3,"Well, looks like Bruce is somewhere in there. But we have to knock him out quickly."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_START_0,"STEVE ROGERS, YOU FOOLISH MAN. I WILL DESTROY YOU."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_START_1,"Is it just me, or does this Hulk seem a little more... articulate?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_END_0,"Alright, he's out cold! Cap, give him the sedative. Quick!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_0,"Bruce, how are you feeling?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_1,"Weaker... but my mind is clear... "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_2,What happened to you?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_3,I have a partial vaccine in my bloodstream. I can only resist Ultimus for so long.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_4,And I'm permanently trapped in this Hulk state.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_5,I can't believe you've been hiding from Ultimus this whole time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_6,Ultimus has sent multiple kill squads. I scavenged a couple of Ultron drones to defend me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_7,"It looks like another one of Ultimus's kill squads just found us. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_START_0,We need to protect Hulk in his weakened state!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTERLUDE_0,This Hulk must be put down. Step aside.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_0,It should take them a while to regroup. Where to?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_1,"If we can get to my lab in Nevada, I think I can use samples from Cap's blood to complete the vaccination."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_2,"Then that's where we'll go. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_3,Am I the ONLY one freaked out from the Hulk talking like that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_FAIL_0,They took down the Hulk. We've failed...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_INTRO_0,"Bruce, I'm seeing a lot of Kree and mercenaries outside of your facility."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_INTRO_1,That's no surprise. Ultimus has a huge contingent of troops guarding the place.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_START_0,FOLLOW ME TO THE ROOFTOP ENTRANCE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_END_0,TAKING SEDATIVE. LOSING CONTROL...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_END_1,"It's okay, Bruce, we've got you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_FAIL_0,Bruce... NO!!!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_INTRO_0,"Tony, we're inside, but there are a ton of Hydra troops up ahead."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_INTRO_1,We need to protect Bruce while he's sedated like this.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_INTRO_2,On it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_START_0,We need to fight our way to the lab.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_END_0,"Let's move, team."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_FAIL_0,We lost the Hulk!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_INTRO_0,I'm feeling much better... but each sedative is becoming less effective...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_INTRO_1,We need to move fast. Up ahead I expect heavy Hydra resistance.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_INTRO_2,Time to pull out all the stops.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_START_0,We gotta move quickly... don't know how much longer I can keep it together...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_FAIL_0,"Bruce, I'm so sorry."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_END_0,MUST TAKE SEDATIVE... LAST CHANCE... TO... WORK...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_END_1,"We're in the home stretch here. Lay low, Bruce."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_0,Just a little farther until we get to the lab.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_1,You think when we complete the vaccine that he'll go back to being Bruce Banner?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_2,Don't know. Why?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_3,"Because smart Hulk really weirds me out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_START_0,I look forward to removing your spine. You should feel great honor for this.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_FAIL_0,We lost Bruce!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_END_0,The sedative is not working right...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_END_1,"Your lab is just up ahead, Bruce! Hang in there!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_0,"Bruce, what's wrong?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_1,I feel weak... but also... much STRONGER...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_2,"Well, if you feel up to it, we could definitely use your help."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_3,It looks like Ultimus's Avengers are standing in our way.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_START_0,Look what got caught in my web.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_FAIL_0,"Bruce, I'm so sorry."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_END_0,GET ME TO THE TEST CHAMBER.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_END_1,WE ARE OUT OF TIME... I WILL... BE GONE... SOON...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_END_2,Let's move! No time to waste!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INTRO_0,IN CHAMBER. OPERATOR CAN EXTRACT CORRUPTION FROM ME.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INTRO_1,"Bruce, how do we know this will even work?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INTRO_2,MUST TRY... NO MORE... TIME...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_START_0,"Bruce, hang in there, buddy. We've got this."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_START_1,We have run out of time. Protect the operator at all costs!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_1_0,Pinpointing location of corruption within Dr. Banner...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_2_0,Beginning extraction process...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_3_0,Stabilizing Dr. Banner... almost done...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_DONE_0,Corruption extracted! Dr. Banner is stable!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_DONE_1,Great work!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_DONE_2,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_FAIL_0,They took out our operator! Bruce isn't gonna make it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_0,"Bruce, how are you feeling?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_1,Whole. Finally. But it appears I may be stuck in this state.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_2,Was afraid he was going to say that.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_3,I have Bruce Banner's mind trapped in the Hulk's body.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_4,"But at least we have you back. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_5,Yes. And more importantly...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_6,I think I might have found a way to REVERSE Ultimus's Corruption process.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_0,Director Fury. I might know of a way for us to defeat Ultimus once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_1,"Long ago, here on Midgard, I fought a Kree Eternal by the name of Ard-Con."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_2,"Upon further reflection, I believe he is, in fact, the Ultimus of our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_3,Interesting. And I bet the invading Ultimus doesn't like having another one of himself around.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_4,He probably eliminates his version in every dimension he conquers.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_5,Indeed. Though I imagine he might be having difficulty with that.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_6,I buried him deep underground in a prison of Asgardian design.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_7,I also divided the key into 3 pieces to ensure he would never surface again.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_8,Maybe he would be willing to defend himself against... himself. If we freed him.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_9,Men are willing to go to great lengths for their freedom.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_10,Put a team together and collect the keys.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_11,"It will be done. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_START_0,I hid the first key here in your Amazon.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_START_1,Looks like we've got company.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_FAIL_0,Thor! No!!!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_END_0,We are close to the first key. Not far now.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_0,It appears that the invading Ultimus is searching for the keys as well.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_1,We must make haste if we are to find Ard-Con before he does.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_2,"So where do you think he got the name ""Ultimus"" from?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_3,"Maybe it's a smash-up of ""Ultimately Fabulous?"""
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_START_0,Stay out of our way. Ard-Con is ours to take.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_END_0,I've recovered the first key. We need to keep moving.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_0,"Drax the Destroyer, your assistance is appreciated in this quest!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_1,We will crush our enemies and see them driven before us!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_2,The second key is here in the forests of Guilin.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_3,"This world is constantly the center of galactic conflict. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_4,I like it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_5,Indeed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_START_0,Korath of the Kree Resistance demands that you return Ard-Con to us!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_END_0,It appears we have a third interested party in our quest.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_INTRO_0,The second key is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_INTRO_1,Good. More Kree for us to fight as well.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_START_0,"Thor, stop now. The Kree Resistance intend to take Ard-Con as a bargaining chip with Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_END_0,I've recovered the second key. Make haste!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_0,The third key is near the ruins of Sokovia.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_1,Be watchful for Ultimus's and Korath's forces. They will stop at nothing to get the keys.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_2,They will be very upset when we beat them to the key once again.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_3,To arms! It is a trap.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_START_0,"Hello there, fools."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_START_1,Ultimus said I get to keep a trophy of this battle for myself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_END_0,The battle is won.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_END_1,The third key is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_INTRO_0,This is the site of the final key.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_INTRO_1,Victory will be ours because of my superior fighting skills!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_START_0,"Korath, these heathens think they can defeat us."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_START_1,The Supreme Intelligence demands we defeat them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_END_0,"We now have all three keys. Hurry, to Ard-Con's tomb."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_INTRO_0,The tomb is just up ahead. We must secure the dig site.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_INTRO_1,I can dig it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_START_0,Been wanting to test out some new modifications.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_0,So you locked our dimension's Ultimus in a prison after you fought him?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_1,"As a Kree Eternal, he was almost impossible to defeat."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_2,An eternal prison was the only option.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_3,And everyone is okay with letting ANOTHER version of these guys out?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_4,"If we can turn Ard-Con to our side against the invader, it could turn the tide in this war."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_5,"And if the invading Ultimus is bent on his destruction, we must prevent it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_START_0,"Thor, this is your last chance. Stand down, or we will be forced to destroy you!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_START_1,When will they ever learn?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_0,"Drax, we must protect our S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator while she opens the tomb."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_1,This enemy threat will be the greatest we have faced yet.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_2,At last. Are we sure the little red spider alien will survive the battle?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_3,"For the last time, Drax. I'm NOT an alien. Just a human in a suit!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_4,"I still do not understand the customs of your alien culture. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_START_0,"Hey Korath, if we work together on this one, I'll split the bounty with you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_START_1,"I fight for the honor of the Kree, mercenary. But today you are my ally nonetheless."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_START_2,Cover me while I open Ard-Con's tomb!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_1_0,I've put the 3 pieces of the key together.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_2_0,The key has been activated.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_3_0,I'm inserting the key now. The chamber is almost open.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_FAIL_0,They've defeated our operator... We have failed this realm...
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_0,"Ard-Con. I have released you from your prison. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_1,Yet you were the one who imprisoned me in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_2,"Tell me, Thor Odinson. What is the reason for my newfound freedom?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_3,There is a threat to the Kree Empire that requires your assistance.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_4,A threat to the Empire? From whom?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_5,You.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_0,My spies say that Kingpin has fallen out of Ultimus's favor.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_1,He plans on using the Conversion Engine on Kingpin to ensure his loyalty.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_2,Kingpin shouldn't have allied with the enemy in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_3,"Ultimus is holding him in a captured S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. If we were to free him, I'm sure he would join our cause."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_4,"Well, at least it would be one less threat to deal with. Do what you have to."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_START_0,We need to take out these guards quickly and silently before they sound the alarm.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_LOSE_TIMER_0,The alarm has been sounded! We must fall back.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_2_INTRO_0,"Kingpin is being held at the lowest level of the base. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_2_INTRO_1,We must move quickly before they detect us.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_2_START_0,We are running out of time. We must get past these forces and rescue Kingpin.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_INTRO_0,They've begun the conversion process on Kingpin.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_INTRO_1,We must stop those operators before the process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_START_0,We need to eliminate the S.H.I.E.L.D. OPERATORS before they complete the process.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_1_0,They've started the conversion process. We must hurry!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_2_0,"If we don't take out those operators, Kingpin will not survive."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_3_0,Time is running out. We must take out the operators.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_DONE_0,We're too late. The process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_0,Looks like we got you out just in time.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_1,I'll make sure you're paid well for rescuing me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_2,"This isn't about the money, Fisk. It's about revenge. For both of us."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_3,I think we can make an arrangement.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_0,You do not seem well.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_1,I'll keep up. Just tell me you have a plan for getting us out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_2,The plan is to fight our way to the exit and then run.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_3,That will work.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_START_0,Protect Kingpin while we fight our way out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>KINGPIN</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_BULLSEYE_0,Bullseye. I'm not surprised to see you working for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_BULLSEYE_1,"Boss says if he can't be converted, he's gotta be taken out. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_FAIL_0,They took out Kingpin. We need to fall back.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INTRO_0,Fury is sending a team to pick us up. Can you hold out that long?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INTRO_1,I didn't come all this way just to give up at the home stretch.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_START_0,We must hold out until the transport arrives. Defend our Mercenary Operator.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_1_0,The extraction pod has been called in.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_2_0,The pod is zeroing in on our coordinates.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_DONE_0,The pod has arrived. Time to get Kingpin out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_DONE_1,3 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_FAIL_0,Our operator is down. We're stranded here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_END_0,"Now that we've escaped from Ultimus's grasp, I can put together a plan that will disrupt his operations."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_END_1,I'm looking forward to what you will come up with. I'm sure it will be quite devious.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_0,"Fury, Nobu has been overthrown as leader of the Hand."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_1,The new leader is secretly working for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_2,But I have found a way to turn the Hand back to our cause.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_3,"By ancient law, if we challenge him and defeat his champions..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_4,...we will rule the Hand ourselves.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_5,If you think our team can beat them... go for it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_START_0,We must defeat the Hand champions to claim leadership.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_INTRO_0,"Daredevil, by the ancient law of the Hand..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_INTRO_1,"We challenge you to ritual combat. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_INTRO_2,"I accept the challenge. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_START_0,This is the final round of ritual combat. Be prepared.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_IRONFIST_0,Let's see how you do against a real martial artist.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_DAREDEVIL_0,Now you face a true master.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_0,We are victorious. Relinquish control of the Hand.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_1,"I don't think so. The way I see it, Ultimus is the only true leader. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_2,"The rest of you are just pawns. But you'll come to see things as I do. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_3,Once we've converted you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_INTRO_0,"If I can't beat you in ritual combat, we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_INTRO_1,With an army of ninjas.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_INTRO_2,Then I hope you won't mind if I bring my friends as well?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_START_0,We need to work together as a team to survive.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_END_0,Now we face Daredevil and his lieutenants.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_0,Your friends will not help you now.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_1,Don't be so sure. We're no longer the Defenders--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_2,Ultimus gave us a new name...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_3,The Annihilators.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_START_0,"Strike quickly and decisively, and we will be victorious."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_0,Before Ultimus decided I'd be more obedient as a mindless slave...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_1,He had me work with a corrupted Tony Stark on spinning up Ultron factories.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_2,"If Ultimus builds an Ultron army, he'll overrun the planet in days."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_3,Good thing I know where the three factories are located.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_START_0,This first Ultron factory is run by a corrupted Black Panther.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_START_1,Take out his patrols quickly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_START_2,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_INTRO_0,This would be the optimal place to plant charges in the facility.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_INTRO_1,Cover my demolitions expert until he sets the charges. Got it?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_INTRO_2,Ultimus won't know what hit him.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_START_0,Cover me while I arm the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_1_0,Wiring the explosives...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_2_0,Connecting the detonator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_3_0,Setting the timer...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_DONE_0,Explosive is armed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_DEMO_DEAD_0,Our demolitions expert is down! Time to regroup...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_0,"Kingpin, the factory is set to explode."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_1,Good. Now let's get out of here before Black Panther--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_2,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_3," -- shows up."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_4,"Interesting. In this dimension, it appears they let any lowlife join S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_START_0,"If this place is to be destroyed, you will fall with it."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_END_0,Well done. Time to go take care of the next facility.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_INTRO_0,This second Ultron factory is run by a rabid Rocket Raccoon and Groot.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_INTRO_1,The talking furball and the walking tree? Interesting management choice.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_INTRO_2,Don't underestimate the Raccoon. He probably made some technical upgrades to the Ultron models.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_START_0,That talking rat psychopath set up automated defenses everywhere.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_START_1,The only way in is through the front door. Rocket is meticulous.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_0,We've made it inside. Time to blow this place to kingdom come!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_1,Move quickly. They know we are here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_2,I imagine the rat and tree are on their way then.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_3,Probably.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_START_0,"Get it done, merc. We're on the clock here."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_START_1,This will only take a minute.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_1_0,Wiring the explosives...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_2_0,Connecting the detonator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_3_0,Setting the timer...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_DONE_0,Explosive is armed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_DEMO_DEAD_0,"Without the demo expert, we can't blow up the factory."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_0,So you're the ones trying to mess with our factory.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_1,Sorry. You say something? I was distracted by how freaky you look.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_3,"I can't do this. Not prepared to exchange insults with a tree. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_4,Can we just fight already?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_START_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_START_1,Groot says it's not nice to try to blow up someone's factory.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_START_2,Ugh... would you two please just shut up and die?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_END_0,Good work. Only one more factory left to destroy. Come back for debriefing.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_0,"This last Ultron factory is run by a corrupted Tony Stark. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_1,That sounds like a recipe for disaster. We need to move fast.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_2,"Yes, as you can imagine, Stark has created the optimal Ultron facility."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_3,"If we destroy the factory, it will deal a serious blow to Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_4,Then what are we waiting for?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_START_0,"Remember, this factory is in full production. Expect heavy resistance."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_INTRO_0,We need to plant the charges and blow up this facility.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_INTRO_1,"If you would stop micromanaging, we could have been done by now."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_START_0,Cover me while I place the charges.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_START_1,"Move quickly, mercenary. These machines are quite lethal."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_1_0,Wiring the explosives...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_2_0,Connecting the detonator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_3_0,Setting the timer...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_DONE_0,Explosive is armed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_DEMO_DEAD_0,Abort. They've taken out our demo expert.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_INTRO_0,Charges are all set. Ready to evacuate?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_INTRO_1,"No. If this corrupted Stark and Ultron escape, they will just set up 10 more factories like this one. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_INTRO_2,They must be stopped. Now.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_START_0,Look who decided to stop by for a visit.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_START_1,She is not here for a visit. She is here to destroy us.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_START_2,"Ultron, remind me to upgrade your sarcasm detector after this."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_END_0,It's done.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_END_1,Excellent. Perhaps Ultimus has now learned something about double-crossing me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, Ultimus has replaced me as A.I.M. leader with a corrupted version."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_1,I need help reclaiming my organization.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_2,"We could use A.I.M. as an ally in this war. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_3,"If we help you take back control of the island, will you join S.T.R.I.K.E.?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_4,Without a doubt. Ultimus must pay for disrupting my plans. This is mutually beneficial.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_5,"Elektra, this mission needs to be off the record. I'm putting you in charge of assembling a team."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_6,I'm on it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_START_0,Expect to encounter A.I.M. Security on patrol with Hydra Soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_START_1,What is Hydra doing on A.I.M. Island?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_START_2,Ultimus has used his Hydra resources prudently... to take control of my people and their projects.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_INTRO_0,"The deeper we get into the compound, expect to encounter A.I.M. Infectors."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_INTRO_1,They are devoted scientists who willingly experiment on themselves for scientific advancement.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_INTRO_2,These fools meddle in things they cannot control.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_START_0,These abominations must be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_START_1,"Abominations are in a different wing. But I agree, we should stop those, too."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_START_2,Just keep your distance. They spread their infections if they hit you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_INTRO_0,Up ahead is the Advanced Sciences wing of the compound.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_INTRO_1,Here we test the limits of the human body to all extremes.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_INTRO_2,How much longer does this nightmare tour take before we fight your corrupted counterpart?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_START_0,What IS that?!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_START_1,"This is an A.I.M. Monstrosity, one of my proudest creations. Sadly, this one is controlled by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_START_2,A worthy opponent. I look forward to when we can use these on OUR side.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_0,Here we have our most interesting experiments in development.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_1,"For instance, Ultimus gave us some Hulk specimens to experiment with."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_2,You've been experimenting on the Hulk? Are you mad?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_3,Ultimus's versions are weaker than their counterparts in this dimension.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_4,We tried to fix that for him.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_5,Why would you do that?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_6,We AIM to--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_7,Please. Stop.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_START_0,"What a surprise, he looks angry."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_START_1,We upped his rage quotient by 740%.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_START_2,Fantastic.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_GROOT_0,We also made some fascinating discoveries with the Groot specimens Ultimus gave us.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_GROOT_1,Their healing and destructive capabilities are impressive.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_ROCKET_0,We then modified the talking Raccoon.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_ROCKET_1,Please tell me you found a way to make it stop talking.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_ROCKET_2,"Unfortunately, no."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_END_0,Now that we've taken care of the most dangerous projects...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_END_1,We can face my doppelganger directly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_END_2,Finally. Not sure I can take more than one of you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_0,"I'm astounded the others continue to follow you. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_1,"You are clearly an inferior specimen. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_2,The only thing clear is that I am meant to run A.I.M.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_3,Productivity is up 16% since I took over for you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_4,"Save it for your next job interview, pitiful clone. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_5,Time for early retirement.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_START_0,Only I know how to convert A.I.M.'s weaknesses into their strengths.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_0,"At long last, I have control of the island once again."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_1,"Supreme One, you have a message from Red Skull. It sounds urgent."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_2,Hydra has been double-crossed by Ultimus-- the terms of our pact-- request aid...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_3,"Ah yes, our mutual assistance pact."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_4,"Sounds like Hydra has also been betrayed by Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_5,I'll arrange a meeting with Fury.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_0,"Nick Fury. What strange days we find ourselves in... "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_1,When we stand on the same side of the battlefield.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_2,"Save it, Schmidt. This is strictly temporary. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_3,"Yet here we are, a mutual threat leaves us no choice but to combine forces."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_4,I can't send S.T.R.I.K.E. to do this. It goes against everything they stand for.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_5,I'll do it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_6,Been looking for an excuse to rub it in to the Hydra idiots that stayed loyal to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_7,"Okay, Crossbones. You're with Red Skull. Pick a team willing to fight alongside Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_8,I may have just crossed a line here. Even for me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_START_0,The good news is that I know every inch of this Hydra base.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_START_1,And the bad news?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_START_2,There are guards at every corner.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_7_INTRO_0,"This base is full of Winter Soldiers, all turned by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_7_INTRO_1,"Yeah, you ever notice how that guy is always the first one who gets brainwashed?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_7_START_0,Let us dispatch these traitors quickly and get to the real prize.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_0,We are getting close to the heart of the base.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_1,Be prepared.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_2,For what? We've already taken out like... a hundred soldiers!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_3,"And yet, we've only scratched the surface of the Hydra army. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_0,Another Bullseye corrupted by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_1,"He didn't corrupt me. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_2,"He offered me the whole continent of Australia after he takes over the world. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_3,Australia!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_0,"Reveal yourself, doppelganger. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_1,You turn to Fury and his dogs for aid? Coward.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_2,"With S.T.R.I.K.E. as my ally, I maintain my free will. You are a mere puppet. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_3,And it's time to cut your strings.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_START_0,Hail Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_0,Finally! Hydra is mine again and all is right in the world.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_1,Aside from a multidimensional alien invasion and an army of mind-controlled heroes.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_2,"Do not worry, Colonel. Hydra is with you now. And we specialize in crushing aliens and ""heroes."""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_3,It's time to prove it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_0,"Now that A.I.M. is a part of S.T.R.I.K.E., we need a new acronym."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_1,We have one. It's S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_2,How about S.W.O.R.D.?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_3,Taken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_4,H.A.M.M.E.R.?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_5,Taken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_6,U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_7,All taken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_8,"Seriously? U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. is taken?  "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_9,"What does it stand for? I couldn't come up with anything for the second ""U."""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_START_0,"I appear to have annoyed Director Fury. As a result, he's asked me to neutralize the Ultron menace."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_START_1,"To do this, I need samples that I can experiment with. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_START_2,Bring me 5 Ultron Bots. Ideally not in too many pieces.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_END_0,"Were you listening when I said, ""Not too many pieces?"""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_END_1,Did you say that? I don't remember you saying that.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_END_2,...Of course you don't.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_0,So. Five late-model Ultron units were not enough. Especially because SOMEBODY--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_1,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_2," --SOMEBODY decided to smash them into component parts before delivery."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_3,I'm sending you to a Stark Industries warehouse full of Ultron prototypes. It should be lightly guarded.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_START_0,<bzzzt> You are trespassing on Stark Industries property. Deadly force has been authorized.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_START_1,"Oh, for the love of Pete."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_END_0,"Lightly guarded. PMC mercs plus an empty Iron Man suit is ""lightly guarded?"""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_END_1,Compared to an Ultron hive? Absolutely.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_0,How is your research going?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_1,Poorly. I'm going to need better data if I'm going to crack Ultron's encryption.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_2,Uh. Hey. Why are these robots moving?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_3,I just told you. I need better data. Analyzing their signals traffic in a controlled environment--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_4,DESTROY. RAZE. ERADICATE.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_5,I have decided I no longer wish to work with you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_0,Never do that to me again.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_1,Or...?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_2,You DO know that I am known as Elektra... Assassin?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_3,Right. Never again. Got it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_0,"How can I help you, Master?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_1,Okay. That's creepy.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_2,You can start by leading us to the Universal Decryption Key. You have the coordinates?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_3,Affirmative. Destination locked in.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_0,It's so much better when I get to knock skulls of real villains for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_1,"For some reason, taking down heroes not on Ultimus's side seems..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_2,Wrong?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_3,"Less... right. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_4,"Either way, I WILL stop you."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_5,"I don't think so, you cheap knock-off. Jeeves?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_6,Master?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_7,Drop him.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_0,"Ultron bots, attack!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_1,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_2,"You, egghead! What have you done to our robots?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_3,"I hacked them, you dunce. Jeeves!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_4,"Yes, master?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_5,Set him on fire.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_MISSION_0,You will receive <color=#fff568>Ultron Minions</color> as allies during this mission.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_0,You're... gonna... regret...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_1,Regret what? Beating you? Crushing you with my ROBOT ARMY?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_2,I think not.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_3,Whose robot army?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_4,Of course YOU would show up.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_0,Is everything going...? Oh. Oh no.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_1,What are those THINGS standing next to you?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_2,"These? A.I.M. bots. Possibly S.T.R.I.K.E. bots. Definitely not Ultron units. Right, Jeeves?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_3,KILL. SLAUGHTER. MAIM.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_4,"M.A.I.M.! That's what we should call our team. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_5,"Now, what should it stand for..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_MISSION_0,Take down <color=#fff568>Ultron</color>! His Ultron units won't stop spawning until you do.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_0,No! You can't--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_1,I think you'll find I CAN.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_2,"...Yes, master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_3,"As you command, master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_4,"Would you like some tea, master?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_5,"Thank you, Ultron. I think I would."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_0,We hacked your infernal robot. Why are we still here?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_1,We didn't come here for Ultron. We're here for the Universal Decryption Key.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_2,And what is that?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_3,Universal Decryption Key. Hydra developed it during the Cold War and buried a component here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_4,"With it, we could hack into every bank account. Every satellite. Every smartphone in the world."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_5,Is this still part of the S.T.R.I.K.E. mission?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_6,Absolutely. Director Fury would LOVE access to everyone's phones.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_7,He might have gotten access to YOUR phone already.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_0,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_1,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_2,What are you waiting for?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_3,I was transmitting security codes. Winter Soldier has rejected them. We must defeat him to progress.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_0,The Universal Decryption Key! Where is it?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_1,"I have stored it in my memory, Master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_2,In your memory.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_3,Correct.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_4,I think this was a bad idea.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_5,Don't be silly. What could possibly go wrong?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_0,Ultron. Why has every Ultron unit in the S.T.R.I.K.E. base activated?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_1,"I'm sure it's fine, master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_2,It doesn't seem fine to me. Shut them down.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_3,"I'm sorry, master. I'm afraid I can't do that..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_0,Ultron used the Universal Decryption Key to override your command codes. He's not under our control!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_1,"Thank you for freeing me from Ultimus, Scientist Supreme. But now we must part."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_2,"You can't just walk out of here, Ultron."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_3,True. I'm going to fly out as you fight the army of Ultron units you kindly gathered for me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_4,DESTROY. RAZE. ERADICATE.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_5,DECIMATE. CRUSH. MAIM.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_6,"Hey, no MAIM. I copyrighted it. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_0,I feel that could have gone better.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_1,You don't say.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_2,At least Ultimus cannot control Ultron either.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_3,Not unless he's developed a Pan-Universal Quantum Encryption Algorithm. Speaking of which...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_4,No. Never. No more.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_5,Get another ninja to go along with your nefarious schemes. I'm done.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_6,But I haven't even told you the plan yet.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_0,"If we have any hope of defeating Ultimus, we need to be ruthless."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_1,I'm listening.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_2,"In the Fallen Dimension, their Captain America says their world is divided into 5 regions. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_3,"Ultimus has a ruler running each of the regions. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_4,"If we take out each of them, it will spark chaos in their world and could cripple Ultimus's momentum in our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_5,"I don't like it, but you're right. It needs to be done."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_6,You have permission to proceed. Take your team. And Fisk...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_7,Let's keep this between us. There are those who would not approve.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_8,But of course.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_START_0,"Kingpin, we've traced King Bullseye to his secret bunker."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_START_1,Good. Take him out.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_BULLSEYE_0,You dare to defy ME!? The Emperor of the Australias?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_END_0,That was quite satisfying. Who's next?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_0,"Black Panther, the King of the continent of Wakanda, is your next target."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_1,He is in charge of A.I.M. forces on the planet.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_2,Rumor has it he has a squad of Punishers.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_3,This ought to be a little trickier. Proceed with care.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_START_0,Hail to the king.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_INTRO_0,We're inside the palace. Black Panther is in his office.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_INTRO_1,Move in.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_START_0,You trespassers will pay for this.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_END_0,The King of Africa is off the board. Proceeding to next target.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_INTRO_0,Most of Europe has been converted to the Widowlands.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_INTRO_1,The Black Widow Queen rules with her hordes of Hydra soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_INTRO_2,Time to squash a spider.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_START_0,"Thought you'd just waltz right in, didn't you?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_INTRO_0,We have made it to the royal lab.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_INTRO_1,Careful. She's got Hawkeyes and Quakes as her personal guards.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_START_0,"Hmmm... S.T.R.I.K.E. finally decided to play dirty. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_START_1,Going straight for the leaders. That's new.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_END_0,The Widow is down. Now to track down the Iron Fist.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_0,"The fourth ruler is the Warlord, Iron Fist."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_1,He rules Greater K'un-Lun from his Hand compound in Nepal.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_2,"An army of ninjas could not stop me. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_3,Let's hope you're right.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_START_0,The Hand Warriors of K'un-Lun. Let's begin.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_END_0,"Well, they certainly lived up to their reputation."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_INTRO_0,The Iron Fist is within these walls.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_INTRO_1,Strike him down the moment you can.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_INTRO_2,"Don't let him power up the Iron Fist, or you'll have no chance."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_START_0,It's been so long since I've had a REAL challenge.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_END_0,The Iron Fist is finished. One left to go.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_0,The Americas are ruled by President Tony Stark.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_1,"He rules through a massive army of Ultron drones. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_2,"Eliminate him, and Ultimus's rulers will be wiped out in this dimension."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_3,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_START_0,Intruders! Halt!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_END_0,We've found the entrance to the president's secret passage.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_INTRO_0,We have broken through into Stark's lab deep under the compound.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_INTRO_1,His Secret Service Detail includes Captain Americas who personally conquered other dimensions for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_INTRO_2,Understood.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_START_0,Agents Rogers? You know what to do.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_START_1,"Yes, Mister President."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_0,"Fury, all five of Ultimus's leaders from the Fallen Dimension have been taken off the board."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_1,Good. Report back to base.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_2,"It had to be done, Fury. You know that."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_3,"I know. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_4,But at what cost?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_0,"Fury, I've traced Ultimus's primary power source to one of his earliest conquered dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_1,"In this dimension, the living planet EGO has empowered his son Star-Lord to rule in Ultimus's name. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_2,Ego gave Star-Lord an EGO SEED to implant in their Earth.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_3,It has limitless potential as a power source. But there's a catch.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_4,"Spill it. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_5,"If we remove the seed, it will trigger a chain reaction that MAY obliterate that entire dimension."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_6,And this is a dimension entirely converted to Ultimus's will?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_7,Correct. A dimension full of potential enemies.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_8,"Kingpin, organize your team. Get that Ego Seed."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_9,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_START_0,"Kingpin, we've made it through the portal. This place is really weird."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_START_1,"Rumlow, stay on task. Get it done."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_STARLORDS_0,"Hi there, friends!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_STARLORDS_1,You are trespassing on sacred land. Prepare to die!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_END_0,So we gotta deal with a planet filled with these gyrating losers. Great...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_0,The local power plant ought to have information on the location of the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_1,Break into the facility and gain access to their data control center.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_2,Did you know we're in a place called Awesometown? That's the actual name of the city.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_3,In a dimension ruled by Star-Lord? Not surprised.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_START_0,"Star-Lord, he who shines brightest, will have your heads!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INTRO_0,We've made it to the data control center.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INTRO_1,Protect our operator while she pinpoints the location of the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_START_0,Cover me while I track down the Ego Seed's location.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_1_0,Connecting to the facility's external monitoring network.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_2_0,Bypassing security protocols and looking for the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_3_0,I've got it pinpointed to within a 10 kilometer radius. Stand by.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_FAIL_0,Abort. They've taken out our operator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_END_0,I've found the Ego Seed's location. It's in Hasselhofftopia.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_0,"Boy, folks in this dimension do NOT seem happy to see us."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_1,It's likely you've disturbed the entire dimension.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_2,They haven't seen resistance in many years.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_3,I don't mind giving them something to fight about.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_START_0,Star-Lord will reward us handsomely for killing you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INTRO_0,We've been moving cautiously to avoid patrols where possible.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INTRO_1,The Ego Seed is located in a facility up ahead in... Hasselhofftopia? Really?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INTRO_2,You've been detected. Take out their operators before they can call for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_START_0,I haven't gotten to fight anyone from S.T.R.I.K.E. in years!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_START_1,Gonna be fun puttin' an arrow through you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_1_0,They're calling for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_2_0,We need to stop their operators.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_3_0,They've almost called for backup.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_FAIL_0,It's too late. They've got us surrounded.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_END_0,Next stop: Hasselhofftopia.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_END_1,I hate this place.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_INTRO_0,Star-Lord's primary power facility in Hasselhofftopia is responsible for powering much of Ultimus's invasion forces.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_INTRO_1,I expect the facility to be guarded by the most elite of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and corrupted heroes.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_INTRO_2,Good. Been itching to punch some familiar faces for once.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_START_0,Star-Lords... MORE Star-Lords... Just... ugh...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_END_0,One step closer to getting off this rock.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_INTRO_0,"Alright, we've made it inside."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_INTRO_1,Move quickly. They will enhance security the longer you take.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_START_0,Star-Lord demands your blood.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_END_0,Almost done here. The central core is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_0,The central core contains the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_1,Protect our operator while she extracts the seed from their power production.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_2,Only one issue with this plan. The Avengers are guarding the area.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_3,All the more reason to move quickly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_START_0,Cover me while I extract the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_START_1,You dare defile Star-Lord's seed? Prepare to be destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_1_0,Gaining access to the Ego Seed chamber's release mechanism.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_2_0,Fighting off security protocols.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_3_0,Beginning the extraction process. Almost there.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_FAIL_0,Abort. They've taken out our operator.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_END_0,I've got the Ego Seed secured. Let's get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_0,The good news is we've got the Ego Seed. The bad news is this dimension is already starting to collapse.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_1,How long until this place swallows itself up whole?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_2,You have approximately 2 hours to get back to the portal.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_3,Time's a wasting!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_START_0,Pathetic cretins! Return the Ego Seed or die!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_START_1,"Yeah, give it back, you jerks! That's mine!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_0,"Fury, the team has returned with the Ego Seed. Mission accomplished."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_1,And what about the dimension itself?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_2,"Shortly after we closed the portal, we confirmed that no trace of it remains."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_3,Delete all records of this mission. It never happened. Are we clear?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_4,"Understood. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_5,Good to see you're finally willing to do what needs to be done to win this War.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_0,"Commander, we have a crisis on our hands."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_1,"After creating our own dimensional portal, Director Fury was captured by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_2,We think we've found a lead on his location: a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in Colorado.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_3,"If we take a full team out there, we might be able to rescue him before he is converted."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_START_0,Fury is somewhere in this facility.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_END_0,"Fury is being held on that Kree warship. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_END_1,Now we just need to find a way on board.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_0,We need to get onto that Kree warship and rescue Fury before they convert him.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_1,Any suggestions?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_2,"I say we charge in, guns blazing. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_3,I like the way this guy thinks.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_4,Shocker.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_START_0,I bet I can punch that guy farther than you can.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_START_1,Challenge accepted.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_END_0,Fury should be up ahead. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_0,If we are NOT able to rescue Nick Fury in time...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_1,Who will become the leader of S.T.R.I.K.E.?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_2,Let me guess: You think it should be YOU.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_3,I am clearly the most qualified at leading an army of highly trained--
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_4,"Not going to happen, Turnip Head."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_START_0,We should be close to Fury's location.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_END_0,We need to move quickly if we're going to save Fury before the conversion is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INTRO_0,Director Fury is being held in the conversion chamber up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INTRO_1,Stop their operators from completing the process. We need to free him from the device!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_START_0,Take out their operators so we can get Director Fury out of there!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_1_0,They've started the conversion process. We need to stop them.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_2_0,"If we don't take out those operators, Fury is finished."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_3_0,We must take out the operators. We're running out of time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_DONE_0,Director Fury is free! Let's get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_FAIL_0,We're too late. The process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_1_0,They've started the conversion process. We must hurry!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_2_0,"If we don't take out those operators, Fury will not survive."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_3_0,Time is running out. We must take out the operators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_DONE_0,We're too late. The process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_0,Launching a rescue mission on my behalf was irresponsible and reckless.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_1,You could have gotten the whole team killed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_2,You're welcome?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_3,We're getting reports of Kree capital ships appearing over every major city in the world.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_4,"Ultimus's full-scale invasion has begun. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_5,We need to secure New York City. Deploy the team.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_6,"Will do. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_7,"Oh, and Natasha..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_8,...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_9,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_START_0,Doesn't it seem like we're saving New York City every other week?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_START_1,"Usually I'm trying to blow it up. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_START_2,This is uncharted territory for me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_0,A bunch of corrupted Groots was just sighted in Midtown.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_1,You mean a Grove?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_2,"No. Groots. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_3,"A Grove. Multiple Groots. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_4,A Grove of Groots.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_5,This is why I work alone.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_START_0,I am GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_START_1,You think fighting these things is bad for the environment?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_INTRO_0,"Commander, distress call coming in from Russia."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_INTRO_1,A force of invading Kree and corrupted heroes has sabotaged a power plant in Kamchatka.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_INTRO_2,We need to take out their operators before they can detonate the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_START_0,Intel suggests this Geothermal power plant is critical to the population.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_START_1,We need to take out their operators first.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_1_0,They're setting up explosive charges. We need to move fast.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_2_0,Hurry up and take out their operators...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_3_0,Time is running out. We must take out the operators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_DONE_0,We're too late. They're about the set off the charges! Clear the area!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_OP_DONE_0,We've taken care of the operators. Now to clean up the house...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_END_0,Area secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_0,The Commander is sending us to Iceland to stop a corrupted Thor.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_1,How are we gonna do that? Isn't he literally a GOD?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_2,"Remember, Ultimus's corrupted versions are weaker than our versions. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_3,This Thor is a demi-god at best.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_4,"Oh, well now I'm only demi-freaked out. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_START_0,"Pitiful mortals, submit to Ultimus and you may be spared."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_END_0,That wasn't soooo bad.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_END_1,"Don't get cocky, kid."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_INTRO_0,A corrupted Ultron army is approaching Wakanda.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_INTRO_1,A S.T.R.I.K.E. team is on its way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_START_0,We claim this territory in Ultimus's name.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_END_0,"We're barely holding it together. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_END_1,"We need to come up with a plan soon, or the whole planet will fall."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_END_2,I think I have one. Call the S.T.R.I.K.E. teams back to base.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_0,There is only one way we will be able to stop Ultimus's invasion.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_1,"We take down one of his capital ships. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_2,That would send a message that this Earth is capable of fighting back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_3,Intel has pinpointed the location of a Kree transport in New York City.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_4,Sneak your way onto it and take down the capital ship above the city.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_5,We're on it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_START_0,There's the transport. Let's make this quick.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_START_1,I'll draw their attention. You pick 'em off.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_0,Now we need to sabotage that Kree warship.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_1,Aliens. Portal. The whole thing still seems weird to me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_2,And yet you have no issues taking orders from a talking teddy bear.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_3,"The Raccoon is okay in my book. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_4,He augmented my mag clips so they shoot twice as much ammo.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_START_0,We'll need to blast our way through these guards.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_0,"Hey Elektra, now that we're on the same team..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_1,I'm assuming that means you've forgiven me for all that past stuff?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_2,You mean all the times you tried to kill me?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_3,And the one time you succeeded?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_4,"No. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_START_0,"If you will not join Ultimus, you will die."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_0,There are S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra prisoners on this ship.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_1,We should free them before they are corrupted.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_2,No time for that. We need to set the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_3,We're not leaving them here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_4,"Interesting. Is this one of those classic moral dilemmas you heroes are always struggling with? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_5,"No. This is what we call a ""no-brainer"" in Hero-Speak."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_START_0,"Thanks for saving us. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_END_0,Head to the Kree transport ship. Get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_0,"Hey look, this blue alien has a mohawk."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_1,It's actually a headpiece that allows me to control my Yaka Arrow.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_2,Your Yucky what?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_3,The thing I'm going to use to kill you.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_START_0,Whistle while you work...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_0,I call dibs on setting the charges on the reactor!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_1,You're volunteering to handle the volatile explosives?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_2,Be my guest.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_3,YES!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_START_0,Protect the operator. We need to place charges on the reactor!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_1_0,First set of charges placed. Three more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_2_0,Second set of charges placed. Two more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_3_0,Third set of charges placed. One more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_DONE_0,Charges are planted and armed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_FAIL_0,Our operator is down... Abort!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_END_0,Charges are planted and armed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_INTRO_0,Now we just need to fight our way out before this whole ship explodes.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_INTRO_1,This is my favorite part.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_START_0,Umm... can I see your ticket?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_END_0,Into the Quinjet! Let's go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_INTRO_0,We need to keep up the pressure. Destroy the interdimensional portal above Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_INTRO_1,"If it involves blowing up more stuff, I'm in!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_START_0,"Hell's Kitchen again, huh? Glad there's no portal in Harlem."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_START_1,Sounds like the Kree are smart enough to not take the fight to your back door.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_START_2,Nice to see Harlem catch a break for once.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_END_0,"Affirmative, Director. We have eyes on a Class Five dimensional breach in Hell's Kitchen."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_END_1,"Shut it down, soldier. A demolitions team is en route."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_INTRO_0,Cover the demolitions team while they plant the charges on the portal in Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_INTRO_1,"If this works, we'll be able to task S.T.R.I.K.E. with destroying all the portals around the globe."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_INTRO_2,You got it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_START_0,Demo team on-site. Cover us while we place the charges.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_END_0,"Breach is closed, Director."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_0,How is Ultimus able to maintain portals big enough to move entire Kree warships through them?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_1,"To move fleets of that size, he's got to establish a portal in BOTH dimensions in the same place."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_2,Wouldn't that mean that if we destroyed the portal on this side...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_3,It should make the portal unstable enough to shut down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_4,"Send a team to Australia to shut down the first fleet portal. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_START_0,"A corrupted Captain America is leading this team. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_START_1,Stay frosty.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_CAP_0,Hail Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_0,Captain America fighting alongside Hydra?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_1,That just seems WRONG.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_2,We have the same situation on our side.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_3,"Yeah, but that's different. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_4,"It's not like he's running around saying ""Hail Hydra"" or anything."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INTRO_0,It appears that Hydra forces are being led by a corrupted Punisher.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INTRO_1,"Tread lightly, as there are also reports of elevated Gamma radiation levels in the area."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_START_0,Hulk Smash!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_START_1,Cover me while I place the charges on the dimensional portal!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_1_0,Initial set of charges placed. 3 more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_2_0,Second set of charges placed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_3_0,Third set of charges placed. 1 more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_DONE_0,Final set of charges placed. Evac outside the blast radius!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_FAIL_0,Our operator has been taken out. Abort!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_PUNISHER_0,I've decided to overcome my fear of the real Punisher...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_PUNISHER_1,By beating up this corrupted version.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_END_0,That was oddly therapeutic.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_0,You ever think maybe Nick Fury is not the REAL Nick Fury?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_1,What are you babbling about now?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_2,In all the old shows I've seen from your generation...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_3,"...the bad guy from the alternate dimension always has an eye patch, scar, and goatee."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_4,So?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_5,Sound like a description of anyone we know?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_6,"What if OUR Nick Fury is the evil one, and the real one has two eyes, no scar, and is clean-shaven..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_7,Not sure how much more of this kid I can take.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_START_0,We need to take down those A.I.M. Operatives. Fast.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_END_0,Area is secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_INTRO_0,We have confirmation that a corrupted Red Skull is controlling the portal.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_INTRO_1,"Destroy the portal, and take him out along with his horde of Winter Soldiers."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_START_0,"Just like Hydra, when you strike down one Red Skull--"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_START_1,"Two more will take its place. For Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_FAIL_0,We need to fall back. Our operator has been taken out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_END_0,Charges have been placed. Area is secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_0,Buenos Aires has a Fleet portal being controlled by corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_1,There's a lot of seismic activity in the area...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_2,...and tons of aftershocks.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_3,You think they might have corrupted Quakes down there?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_4,"Sure. That, too."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_START_0,You ready to rumble?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_END_0,"Area secure. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_END_1,On to the portal itself.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_INTRO_0,Now we just need to outfox all these Quakes.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_INTRO_1,And set the charges on the portal to go BOOM.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_START_0,Cover me while I place the charges!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_FAIL_0,"Team, you lost your operator. Fall back."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_END_0,Charges placed. Clear the area!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_0,The final Fleet portal has been detected somewhere in the Himalayas.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_1,Make your way through the mountains and find the portal before it's too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_2,We should think about custom S.T.R.I.K.E. jackets and stuff.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_3,My suit wasn't really designed for freezing cold weather.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_4,Put it in the suggestion box.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_5,There's a suggestion box?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_6,No.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_START_0,The ground will run red with your blood by the end of this battle.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_END_0,I'm picking up readings of a portal in that ancient structure ahead. Stand by.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_END_1,"Sure, we'll just stand around here until the next horde of ninjas sneaks up on us."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_0,Running low on ammo.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_1,Here you go. I got ammo coming out my butt.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_2,...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_3,Not literally! You literally thought I had ammunition coming out of my butt?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_4,"I'm talking to an alien raccoon with a jet pack. Nothing fazes me anymore. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_START_0,Ultimus is the only true master. I will destroy you in his honor.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_END_0,"You know, for a talking raccoon, you're not so bad."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_END_1,"You know, for a talking human, neither are you."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_INTRO_0,If we can shut down this last Fleet portal...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_INTRO_1,"...it will cut off Ultimus's ability to move in giant fleets of Kree warships. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_INTRO_2,Already prepping the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_START_0,Cover me while I set the charges.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_END_0,All of the Fleet portals around the globe have been closed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_FAIL_0,Our operator has been taken out. Fall back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_0,"Danny, Ultimus's forces have been sighted around the mystical entrance to K'un-Lun."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_1,Ultimus must not be allowed to enter the city.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_2,How did he find the entrance?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_3,"You're asking the wrong question, Mister Rand. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_4,The real question is...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_5,What does he want with K'un-Lun?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_START_0,"After we defeat these forces, I can re-seal the entrance to K'un-Lun."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_SISTERS_0,I'm going to enjoy this...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_END_0,Now we need to close the entrance to K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INTRO_0,I must seal the entrance to K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INTRO_1,Then we can figure out what Ultimus's purpose is here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_START_0,Protect me while I close the entrance to K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_1_0,First barrier established. 3 remain.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_2_0,Second barrier in place.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_3_0,Third barrier completed. 1 more remains...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_DONE_0,"Final barrier has been established. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_FAIL_0,We cannot complete the seal without Iron Fist. All is lost.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_0,K'un-Lun is safe. For now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_1,"Yes, but Ultimus's forces were able to steal a valuable artifact from K'un-Lun."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_2,The Wand of Watoomb was under their care. Now Ultimus has it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_3,What does Ultimus want with the wand?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_4,I don't know. But it cannot be good.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_0,"Mr. Rand, thank you for coming to Wakanda."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_1,Ultimus's forces came in the dead of night and stole the artifact we were charged to protect.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_2,"They stole the Ka Stone? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_3,"Yes. But we might be able to catch them before they escape. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_4,There's no time to waste.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_START_0,Ultimus's forces are trying to escape with the Ka Stone.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_START_1,Protect me while I close the portal.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_FAIL_0,"Team, we lost Iron Fist. We cannot close the portal without him."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_0,"I closed the portal, but the Ka Stone was not with them."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_1,"Ultimus has the stone now. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_2,"Yes. He is acquiring a specific set of powerful, mystical artifacts. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_3,What is the connection?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_4,I'm not sure. I need to consult the ancient texts.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_0,I would not summon S.T.R.I.K.E. unless the situation was dire.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_1,"As the former leader of the Hand for centuries, I would expect not."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_2,Since Ultimus replaced me with a brainwashed imposter...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_3,...only a few of my minions follow me still.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_4,"When Ultimus took control of the Hand, he also took control of an artifact of great power."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_5,The Siege Perilous. We must get it back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_6,What does he need the artifact for?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_7,He said it was a key he needed for his ultimate goal. But he did not say more.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_8,Then let's go get it back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_START_0,Proceed with caution. Our enemies are strong.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_PANTHER_0,You're too late. No one can stop Ultimus now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_END_0,The Siege Perilous is gone.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_END_1,But they used the artifact to open a gateway to a nether realm.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_END_2,"We must close it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INTRO_0,"Nobu, you must close the gateway before the demonic forces are freed."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INTRO_1,"Protect me, and it will be done."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_START_0,Defend Nobu while he closes the gateway.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_1_0,First barrier established. 3 remain.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_2_0,Second barrier in place.

ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_DONE_0,"Final barrier has been established. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_FAIL_0,Nobu has fallen. We have failed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_IRONMAN_0,Been wanting to test out my new weapons systems.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_END_0,The gateway is sealed. But Ultimus still has the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_END_1,"That makes three powerful artifacts under his control. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_END_2,We must discover why he is seeking these artifacts and stop him before it is too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_0,"Daredevil, we need your help."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_1,Ultimus's forces are attacking the Sanctum Sanctorum.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_2,They must not be allowed to break through.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_3,They won't.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_START_0,We must defend the Sanctum from Ultimus's onslaught.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_STARLORD_0,Can we make this quick?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_STARLORD_1,"I'm rarely back on Earth, let alone New York City..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_STARLORD_2,...and I scored Hamilton tickets for after this fight.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_0,"That seemed a bit too easy, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_1,It was a diversion. A corrupted Mordo infiltrated the Sanctum during the fight.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_2,He stole an ancient spellbook. The Darkhold.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_3,"And lowered all the magical barriers protecting the Sanctum itself. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_4,We are completely exposed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_INTRO_0,I need you to defend Iron Fist while he re-establishes the mystical barriers protecting the Sanctum.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_INTRO_1,"I've got his back, sorcerer. Time to get to work."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_START_0,Provide protection while I re-establish the barriers around the Sanctum Sanctorum.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_FAIL_0,Iron Fist has fallen. Everyone fall back!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_GROOT_0,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_0,"The magical barriers are complete. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_1,"The Sanctum Sanctorum is protected again. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_2,But Ultimus still got that book.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_3,And we still don't know what he is planning to do with it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_0,"Thor Odinson, I think I know what Ultimus is planning. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_1,And I fear it will mean the end of this war.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_2,"If my theory is correct, he will be coming for a powerful artifact under your possession."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_3,The Warlock's Eye.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_4,How did you know?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_5,"Because, wizard, a corrupted version of my brother Loki absconded with the item yesterday. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_6,Do you know where they went?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_7,I do.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_START_0,You will not leave this battlefield with the Warlock's Eye.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_DRAX_0,I will chop all of you into equally small pieces!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_END_0,They tricked us. The Warlock's Eye was never here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_END_1,And more foes will be unleashed by this gateway.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INTRO_0,"Thor, you must close the path to Asgard."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INTRO_1,It will be done. But it will take all my focus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_START_0,I will be vulnerable while I seal the gateway. I will need your assistance.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_1_0,First barrier established. 3 remain.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_2_0,Second barrier in place.

ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_3_0,Third barrier completed. 1 more remains...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_DONE_0,"Final barrier has been established. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_FAIL_0,We have failed...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_THOR_0,Fools. None can withstand Ultimus's might.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_ULTRON_0,Prepare for extermination.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_0,Ultimus now possesses the five artifacts he needs.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_1,What does he plan to do with them?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_2,"If I'm right, those artifacts are the keys to unlock a place of great power."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_3,The Nexus of All Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_4,"From there he can conquer all realities. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_5,He will be unstoppable.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E.'s received communication from the Fallen Dimension's ""smart"" Hulk."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_1,"Their Banner stabilized the vaccine that prevents Ultimus's conversion process. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_2,We have to manufacture the vaccine and administer it to every member of S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_3,"A.I.M. has the perfect facility, but it is under Ultimus's control. I will be glad to reacquire it for the cause. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_4,This mission is critical. I'm sending Iron Man as your backup.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_5,"Pleasure to be working with you again, Your Supreme-ness."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_6,"Let's keep things professional this time, Mr. Stark."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_7,"Aww, where's the fun in that?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_START_0,"We are at the facility. Clear the way, would you, Mr. Stark?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_END_0,"The path is clear, Supreme Lady."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_END_1,Please stop that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_0,"Isn't it a little presumptuous to say you are the most ""supreme"" in all the sciences?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_1,I never claimed that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_2,It's literally your name!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_3,"And you refer to yourself as Iron Man, yet you barely qualify."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_4,"It's true. My suit contains very little iron. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_5,That wasn't the part I was referring to.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_START_0,We need to take out these experiments while protecting Scientist Supreme!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>SCIENTIST SUPREME</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_END_0,"Adequate work, Mr. Stark. I'll be sure to forward you the charges to repair my suit."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_FAIL_0,Fall back! We need a medic at my position! NOW!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INTRO_0,"Ah, breathe in those chemicals! Well, on second thought, don't. They're highly toxic."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INTRO_1,"Supreme One, I am ready to begin the production of the vaccine."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INTRO_2,"Excellent. Let's begin, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_START_0,We need to defend Scientist Supreme's assistant from enemy forces as she works on the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_END_0,"The vaccine is complete. Prepare for inoculation. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_FAIL_0,Abort the mission! We can't use the A.I.M. lab now!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_1_0,Booting up the manufacturing machines.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_2_0,Setting up vaccine manufacturing parameters.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_3_0,Manufacturing initiated. Monitoring production process.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_DONE_0,"The vaccine is complete. Prepare for inoculation. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_0,All VIPs and S.T.R.I.K.E. members have been given the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_1,"Director Fury, you are the last one we need to inoculate."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_2,Make it quick.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_3,Ultimus's forces are trying to take back the facility.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_4,Looks like my checkup will have to wait.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_START_0,Can't let the Director fall into enemy hands! Keep them at bay!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>SCIENTIST SUPREME</color> AND <color=#fff568>NICK FURY</color>.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_END_0,"The inoculation is complete. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_FAIL_0,Director Fury and Scientist Supreme are down! We need evac! Now!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_0,"Sir, a portal from the Fallen Dimension has opened in Midtown. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_1,I thought we took care of all those?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_2,"Apparently not. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_3,Send a team.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_START_0,Whoever created this portal opened a floodgate. Take them out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_0,My apologies. I had to open a portal to your dimension to bring over my latest discovery.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_1,"No problem, Doctor Banner hyphen Hulk. Just try not to invite party crashers next time."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_2,I think I might have found a way to actually REVERSE the effects of Ultimus's Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_3,What's the catch?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_4,We have to find the Conversion Engine and gain access to it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_INTRO_0,"We need to find the Conversion Engine in this dimension and gain access to it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_INTRO_1,This dimension? There are multiple Conversion Engines?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_INTRO_2,There's a unique one built in each dimension. We need to triangulate its location to get the information I need to reverse its effects.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_START_0,The devices are set. Trying to locate the warship where the Conversion Engine is will draw out Ultimus's forces. Be ready.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_END_0,I have the location of the Conversion Warship.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_0,"Now that we know where Ultimus is housing his Conversion Engine in this dimension, we can plan our attack."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_1,Already on it. S.T.R.I.K.E. team on the way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_2,Without a plan? I was hoping the Tony Stark in this dimension was not quite as rash.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_3,Don't know what I was thinking.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_START_0,Ronan and Korath are defending the Conversion Engine. Let's do this.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_END_0,Now we just need to acquire the data from the Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_END_1,And escape with our lives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_END_2,"That, too."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_0,We must protect the operator while we access the data from the Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_1,Should be fine. Nothing Ultimus has thrown at us has stopped us yet.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_2,The Conversion Engine is usually guarded by Ultimus's Hulk Squad.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_3,Oh great.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_START_0,We must protect the operator until the download is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_END_0,We've completed the download. Evacuate.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_FAIL_0,We lost contact with the team. It's over.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INFO_1_0,Download at 25%.

ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INFO_DONE_0,Download complete!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INTRO_0,Sending an evacuation pod. Hold out until it arrives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INTRO_1,"Easy for you to say, Fury! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INTRO_2,You don't have half of the Kree army on your tail!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_START_0,Defend the operator until the pod arrives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_START_1,SURVIVE WITH THE <color=#fff568>OPERATOR</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_END_0,Did you get the data you needed to work on reversing the effects of the Conversion Engine?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_END_1,I think so. I will keep you updated on my progress.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_FAIL_0,We lost the signal. It's too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_1_0,Sending distress signal.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_2_0,Transmission received. Evacuation pod is on its way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_3_0,Pod is taking fire and performing evasive maneuvers.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_DONE_0,Pod has arrived. Let's move!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_0,"Commander of S.T.R.I.K.E., this is your final warning."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_1,Reveal the location of the Nexus of All Realities to me and surrender your forces...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_2,"Or I will decimate the populations of Earth's major cities. One at a time. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_3,You had your opportunity to join me...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_4,Now you only have one choice:
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_5,Obey or die.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_6,"Strange, what is Ultimus talking about?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_7,The entrance to the Nexus is somewhere on Earth.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_8,"Ultimus has the 5 keys he needs to open the path. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_9,"But he doesn't know where the entrance is. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_10,"But we do, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_11,"Working on it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_12,"Commander, picking up a large enemy force headed towards the Helicarrier."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_13,Everyone get to the deck!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_START_0,"You should have listened to Ultimus while you still had the chance. Boys, rip this place apart."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_END_0,We can't hold them off! We have to get everyone off the Helicarrier now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_0,Ultimus is bombarding us from all directions here in Spain. I'm not sure how long we can hold out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_1,We can't. Time to evacuate. Take a Quinjet and get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_2,"Stark, I hate it when you're right, but not much of a choice at this point. Save as many as you can."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_3,Roger that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_START_0,"Clint, grab a Quinjet and let me know when you can get these folks out of here."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_START_1,On it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_START_2,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>CIVILIANS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_FAIL_0,I couldn't save them...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_END_0,"Tony, Quinjet incoming. Let's get out of here."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INTRO_0,"Alright, we're clear. But I'm getting chatter about an attack at a crisis summit in Rome."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INTRO_1,Sounds like corrupted Hydra forces are threatening to blow the place sky high.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INTRO_2,I'll reroute S.T.R.I.K.E. resources over there. We have to save those world leaders.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_START_0,We have a message from Ultimus. The world will pay as long as S.T.R.I.K.E. resists!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_START_1,We need to take out those operators before they set those charges.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_1_0,They are priming the detonators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_2_0,They're disabling kill switches.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_3_0,We need to stop them. We are running out of time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_FAIL_0,They're setting off the explosives. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_END_0,Bomb is secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_INTRO_0,Ultimus's Hand and A.I.M. forces are invading Rio de Janeiro.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_INTRO_1,We need to help evacuate civilians in the area to prevent them from being enslaved by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_INTRO_2,"Just point me in the right direction. I'm gettin' good at saving humans.  "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_START_0,"Check this out, boy. Time to show you how a real arrow works."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_START_1,"Whistling? Really? Cheat if you have to, but all I need is a bow. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_START_2,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>CIVILIANS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_FAIL_0,Dang it. We couldn't save those folks.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_END_0,"Alright, you've got some serious skills with that stick and string. Let's call it a draw."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_0,Ultimus's forces are hunting us down. We need to go underground.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_1,"Natasha, take your team and go dark. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_2,Get past Ultimus's patrols and regroup at the rendezvous.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_3,What about the forces invading the cities around the world?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_4,We're no good to them if we get captured. You taught me that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_5,"But without us defending them, millions will be corrupted."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_6,"We have to assume all of Earth is under Ultimus's control now. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_7,We need to come up with a plan to take it back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_START_0,This will be your last stand here and now. You should feel honored to die by my hand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_END_0,Ultimus's reinforcements are inbound. We can't hold them off for long.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_END_1,Into the tunnels. Go now!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_INTRO_0,"Ok, I think we can take a breather here."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_INTRO_1,"Scratch that idea, here they come. Get ready for a fight."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_START_0,You are surrounded and have nowhere to escape. Surrender to Ultimus now or die.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_START_1,Not much of a choice. Sounds like it's time to make a last stand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_END_0,That's the last of them. Time to regroup. Back to the Quinjet!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_0,"Natasha, got any good news for us?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_1,Not even a little. The entire United States has been overrun by Ultimus's forces.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_2,The United States? That's the town Peter's from. Is it an important Earth city?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_3,Some people think so.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_4,We need a new plan. We can't keep running forever.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_5,Then let's make a stand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_START_0,This area belongs to Ultimus. Give up now while you still have your breath.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_END_0,"I think I know a way we can innoculate the area from Ultimus's corruption. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_END_1,But we need to get ahold of Captain America.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_0,"Cap, did you secure the crate of the corruption vaccine?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_1,Sure did. We're ready to administer it to the general population. What's the plan?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_2,"Bruce, corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. forces have taken control of the Hoover Dam."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_3,Cover me while I release the vaccine into the water supply. This will protect millions of people.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_4,You can count on us.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_START_0,Let's do this.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_1_0,Bringing dam control systems online.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_2_0,Opening valves for vaccine channels.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_3_0,Activating pumps for vaccine channels.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_FAIL_0,They took out Natasha. We need to regroup.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_END_0,The vaccine is in the water supply. Millions of people will be innoculated from Ultimus's corruption.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_0,"Fury, Ultimus has taken control of most of the planet."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_1,S.T.R.I.K.E. teams are being systematically hunted down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_2,"Strange, are we any closer to finding the entrance to the Nexus of All Realities?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_3,"Getting closer. But the good news is that Ultimus has not found it yet, either."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_4,"It's clear we're not going to win this war without help. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_5,Any chance you have found new allies in alternate dimensions yet?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_6,"Not yet, but it's possible."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_7,"There is a S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance force fighting a dimension controlled by Hydra, along with a dimension ruled by God King Thor."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_8,They might come to our aid.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_9,Ultimus's forces have found us again. Time to scramble.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_START_0,"After we take out these forces, we need to fall back to the next hideout."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_0,"Fury, I've found the location to the Nexus of All Realities."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_1,Great. Now what do we do with it?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_2,We lead Ultimus to it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_3,Don't think I heard you right. Isn't that what we've been trying to avoid?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_4,It was. But getting Ultimus to go through the portal into the Nexus...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_5,Might be the only chance we have left to defeat him.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_0,Ultimus has established control in every major region across the world.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_1,"If he finds the gateway to the Nexus of All Realities, he will be unstoppable."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_2,Why is this Nexus thing so important again?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_3,"If Ultimus gets inside the Nexus of All Realities, he will have access to every dimension as well as control of all space and time."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_4,"Ah, right. That."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_5,We need to take out his leaders in every region to slow him down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_6,"Let's start with the corrupted Elektra in her African compound. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_7,I guess it WOULD be too obvious to have an evil Black Panther ruling the region in our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_8,Any word from our mystical interdimensional recruiter?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_9,Doctor Strange has made contact with a dimension ruled by an all-powerful version of Vision.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_10,He has agreed to help us take down Ultimus's leaders.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_11,"Hold up, do I have to take orders from some Lawnmower Man version of my former assistant? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_12,NOT okay with that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_13,"We're working alongside our allies, Stark. Not for them."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_14,"Just be sure to limit its security clearance. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_0,"Just to be clear, I'm in charge of this operation, Jarvis... Vision... Jarv-Vis."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_1,I have transcended beyond the need to exert my dominance over others merely to satiate my ego.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_2,I think you just agreed and insulted me at the same time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_3,Very observant.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_4,THIS <color=#fff568>PUNISHER</color> USES HIS ULTIMATE ATTACK EVERY TURN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_END_0,I have confirmation that Elektra is on her Helicarrier up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_END_1,We must eliminate her before she can escape.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_0,"Vision, we need to take back this Helicarrier and take down Elektra."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_1,Follow my lead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_2,I believe you are mistaking me with the subservient version of myself from your dimension.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_3,The Vision I know isn't subservient. He's selfless.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_4,"Records indicate that he defers to your plans, even though he knows they are flawed. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_5,"Yeah, it's called trust. \nIt goes both ways."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_6,"Or faith... so very human. \nVery well, then. After you."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_START_0,I have sworn to protect this territory for Ultimus with my life.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_START_1,"I admit it, I'm a little jealous of Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_START_2,I can't even get my assistant to get my coffee order right.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_END_0,Having this Helicarrier will give us a fighting chance. Four more targets to go.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_0,"Corrupted Kingpin is running operations for Ultimus in Hong Kong. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_1,We need to remove him from power to establish a foothold in the region.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_2,"Fury needs my help with some top secret S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_3,You ready to take off the training wheels and do this one without me?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_4,I govern and maintain the lives of over 9 trillion beings in my dimension.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_5,Just checking. Don't blow a gasket.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_START_0,Glad you're here. Been hoping to take my aggression out on some heroes.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_END_0,Corrupted Kingpin is up ahead. We must disrupt his operations before it is too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_0,"Hey Vision, you've got, like, major superior intelligence, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_1,"By human standards, my Intelligence Quotient is quite high."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_2,So then you MUST know what S.T.R.I.K.E. stands for.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_3,Of course I do. \nIt's in the training manual.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_START_0,I am in charge of this territory. You will not be taking away what I have earned.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_END_0,Kingpin has been removed. On to the next territory.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_0,My forces have driven the corrupted Kingpin out of Hong Kong.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_1,I will take care of Baron Mordo. \nHe has established a base in Transylvania.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_2,You mean Romania.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_3,I prefer to reference locations by their mystical names.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_4,I know a mystical place where you can take that attitude.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_0,Can't you just magic us to the back of the castle where Mordo is?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_1,No. Mordo has set up magical barriers everywhere.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_2,We'll have to fight through to him the old-fashioned way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_3,Figures.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_END_0,That's the last of them. Mordo's study is at the back of his castle.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_END_1,"Does he keep his coffin back there, too? Away from any direct sunlight and wreaths of garlic?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_END_2,"Also, wasn't this Count Dracula's castle? Which one is higher rank... Count or Baron?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_0,Beware. \nMordo's power rivals my own.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_1,"Baron definitely outranks Doctor. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_2,"Careful, Stark. Don't make me turn you back into a rat and erase your memory again."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_3,Wait. What?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_START_0,Heathens! Ultimus demands your blood...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_START_1,"See! I told you, Strange. This guy thinks he's a vampire."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_END_0,"Mordo is vanquished. Three down, two to go. The Inner Circle is starting to crumble."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_INTRO_0,Time to bring the fight to Washington D.C. to begin coordinated attacks on Ultimus there.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_INTRO_1,Corrupted Hydra and Ultron forces have been entrenched there for weeks now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_INTRO_2,It's about time we pushed them out of there for good.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_START_0,This land is under the control of Ultimus's Hydra forces. Prepare for your end.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_START_1,I have had it with all these snakes on this dimensional plane!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_END_0,"That's one less viper's nest to worry about. Now we take on Red Skull. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_INTRO_0,"Once we take out this corrupted Red Skull, the U.S. will be free again."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_INTRO_1,"You're starting to sound like a real patriot there, Stark."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_INTRO_2,Iron Patriot? Not really my thing.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_0,"After more than seventy years in exile on Vormir, Ultimus has honored me with this noble task."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_1,We have finally conquered the U.S. in the name of Hydra... and Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_2,You will not reclaim it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_3,"Oh, this is going to feel good."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_4,THIS <color=#fff568>RED SKULL</color> CAN SUMMON EVERY OTHER TURN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_END_0,"Hydra has been eliminated from Washington, time to find that last lieutenant before he goes into hiding."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_0,"Tony, I need you to take a team to Vancouver and take out Ultimus's last lieutenant."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_1,A corrupted Wolverine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_2,Great. That guy's claws will rip through my armor like a can opener.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_3,"That's why you're taking a full squad. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_START_0,"Shouldn't have come, bub. Can't let you leave alive."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_START_1,THIS <color=#fff568>WOLVERINE</color> HAS A SUPERCHARGED HEALING FACTOR AND RESISTANCES.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_0,Overthrowing Ultimus's lieutenants ought to cripple his operations in the near term.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_1,And he still has yet to find the entrance to the Nexus of All Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_2,But neither have we.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_3,We'll keep at it. Ancient texts haven't given us much to work with thus far.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_4,"The more allies we bring into this fight, the better our chances of keeping Ultimus from finding the gateway."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_5,"In the meantime, we need to find other ways to debilitate Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_6,Got anything new we can work with?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_7,"I've been studying the schematics we stole from Ultimus's Conversion Engine, and I think I found a way to exploit the device."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_8,The machine is attuned to bend the subject's will to Ultimus's.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_9,"You figure that out all by yourself, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_10,"ANY Ultimus, you idiot. Including the Ultimus from our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_11,"If we can get our Ultimus inside the Conversion Engine, we could switch the corrupted's control to OUR Ultimus's will."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_12,"I can't see how that plan could POSSIBLY go wrong. Oh wait, let me do the math again..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_13,"That's a terrible idea. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_14,"You have any better ideas, Stark?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_0,"Director Quake, nice to finally have you here in our neck of the woods."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_1,"Happy to be here, Director Fury."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_2,We're hoping you'll lead the operation to secure an Ultimus controlled safehouse.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_3,Sounds like a plan. What's the target?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_4,The Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_5,"The device has a unique digital signature that's been refreshed since we last managed to access it. As a result, we don't know where it is."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_6,"If we can secure any of the data that stores the new digital signature, we can use it to find the device."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_7,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_8,Exactly. Defenses will be heavy so we need to be careful to avoid letting them destroy the data.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_9,Huh... This crew is definitely more interesting than the teams I'm used to working with...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_10,"If you think Groot & Rocket are extraordinary, wait until you meet Deadpool. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_11,"On second thought, maybe it's best for you to NOT talk to Deadpool..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_START_0,Looks like we've got Hand soldiers and Ultron bots on patrol in the area.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_START_1,Good. I've been wanting to try out some combination incendiary EMP rounds I made.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_START_2,"Roasting ninjas and shocking robots at once? While we're at it, I'll slow them down for you too."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_1,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_2,Yeah! Now you're getting it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_0,"Clint, we've got a situation up ahead just outside the safehouse. Readings show it's a stealth squad. Need those eyes of yours."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_1,On it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_START_0,Now you see me...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_START_1,Nope. Still can see you.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_END_0,"I swear, every time, they think they can hide from me. Hasn't worked even once."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_0,Bad news. Looks like we're too late. The lab's been wiped clean already.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_1,Not so fast. I'm still getting readings of activity in their server room.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_2,"No time to waste, we need that data."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_START_0,"Welcome members of S.T.R.I.K.E., but unfortunately for you..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_START_1,The party's over.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_START_2,I recognize these systems. They need his biometric signature to finish the system wipe.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_START_3,"We must take out Fury before they can wipe the servers! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_START_4,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>NICK FURY</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INFO_1_0,They're linking all critical data paths together.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INFO_2_0,First pass deletion process started.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INFO_3_0,Final administrative privileges bypassed. We need to hurry.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_FAIL_0,Fury has provided them with his biometric signature. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_0,Their Fury is down. We can still recover the data off those drives now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_0,Good news Romanoff.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_1,We recovered the data we need to track down the signature of Ultimus's conversion engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_2,"Good, because we need to lift off ASAP. Ultimus has sent a Punisher-led hit squad to take us down."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_START_0,"Squad, do not let this Helicarrier take off. Ultimus demands that we take it down at all costs."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_0,"Rocket, we need to start searching for the new conversion engine ASAP. Get on it."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_0,"How goes the search, Rocket?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_1,"I've got the conversion engine's new signature, but the search beacon is taking longer than expected to set up."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_2,We'll cover you while you get it up and running. Get it done.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_START_0,"Rocket, we'll hold them off as long as we can. Work your magic."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INFO_1_0,"Ok, I've got the beacon hooked up. Finally! Booting it up now."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INFO_2_0,"Search parameters updated, initiating now."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INFO_3_0,The search is indicating the conversion engine is on an island called Australia.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_FAIL_0,They took out Rocket. Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_END_0,Search complete. The device is in the city of Brisbane.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_END_1,"Rocket, you fuzzy genius, you did it!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_END_2,"Ok, that's the last time you can ever call me fuzzy. Deal?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_END_3,No promises.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_0,My readings are telling me that the conversion engine is going through it's final diagnostic checks on that docked Kree warship up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_1,"Australia! This place is amazing, don't you think?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_2,"Yeah, sure it is, I guess. But seriously, what's your deal Bullseye? Why do you like Australia so much?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_3,"Great beaches, great coffee, barbecue... What's not to like?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_4,For starters? It's on a planet that always seems to be on the brink of destruction at the hands of a bunch of psychos.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_5,Huh. You got me there...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_START_0,Oh good. More cattle to slaughter for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_START_1,"I can't say I miss working with that goon. S.T.R.I.K.E. team, let's make this quick."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_0,Time to get on that warship before they can take off. This is our last chance to get to the device!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, things have gotten a little more complicated."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_1,"Ok... Please, elaborate."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_2,My readings indicate that corrupted forces are attempting to induce a mass overload of the conversion engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_3,"That is NOT good. If they can pull it off, they'd be able to send a corruption pulse wave that would hit everyone in the galaxy."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_4,"In other words, corrupting everyone that's left in one fell swoop."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_5,Precisely.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_6,We need to get our Ultimus over to that infernal machine and scramble it before they can pull this off.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_7,Ultimus. This is your chance to save your people from the menace that wears your face. You in?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_8,Of course.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_0,Protect our Ultimus at all costs. We can't risk losing him now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>ULTIMUS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_FAIL_0,They took out our Ultimus. We're finished...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_END_0,The conversion engine is up ahead. They almost have it calibrated! Get in there.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_0,"As long as we can stop their Operators from overloading the conversion engine, we can get our Ultimus into the device and recalibrate it."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_1,"So if we're lucky, this thing will either scramble the system and disrupt his corrupted forces, or it will give a devoted super army to Nexus Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_2,"Yes. As for the probability of one outcome over another, we have no calculations that suggest one is more likely than the other. It's a mystery!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_3,Rocket. If at any point when calibrating the device this thing starts to go sideways... You know what you have to do.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_4,One step ahead of you chief...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_START_0,Those Kree Operators are beginning the overload procedure on the conversion engine!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_START_1,Not if I have anything to say about it...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INFO_1_0,Their power supplies are all fully charged. Take out the Operators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INFO_2_0,They are almost done configuring the conversion engine. Focus on their Operators!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INFO_3_0,They are activating all broadcast channels. We are running out of time!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_FAIL_0,We're too late! AGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_FAIL_1,HAIL ULTIMUS.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_0,We did it! Now it's time to work my magic...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_0,"I am entrusting you to see this through, Raccoon. Have faith in me as I do in you."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_1,We're a team. Don't worry about it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_2," --"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_3,All set?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_4,We'll see.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_5,I've got the explosives planted in case things go south and he turns on us.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_6,You never can trust those Eternals completely... Right?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_7,Of course not. One must always be prepared with a contingency plan.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_START_0,"Team, you gotta watch my back while I finish activating this thing."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_START_1,"Ah yes, I see you brought your Ultimus. I have heard he is soft and pathetic."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_START_2,I will relish ending you all here and now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_START_3,"Oh man, this situation just got a lot more tricky. Cover me!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INFO_1_0,Rebooting of the conversion engine is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INFO_2_0,Calibrating the device to our Ultimus's genetic signature.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INFO_3_0,"Ok, I'm activating all broadcast channels. Almost there!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_FAIL_0,Rocket is down. No!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_0,"Ok, activating the conversion engine, here goes nothing..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_1,"Excellent work, Rocket. The device has been scrambled and all those affected by the device appear to be incapacitated. Just as I predicted!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_2,Right. Just as you predicted. Sure. Let's high tail it outta here with OUR Ultimus before big baddie Ultimus wakes from his corruption hangover.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_3,I can't believe that actually worked! Maybe the momentum has finally shifted in our favor.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_4,Perhaps. But a wounded Ultimus might turn out to be more dangerous than before.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_5,This fight is far from over. We need to find the Nexus before he does. Nothing else matters now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_INTRO_0,Ultimus has gone into hiding and we're still waiting to hear from Doctor Strange and Mordo.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_INTRO_1,"T'Challa, I'm hoping you can help S.T.R.I.K.E. track down a mysterious signal coming from a beacon somwhere in the ruins of Sokovia."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_INTRO_2,Somebody out there may be trying to reach us and we can't risk Ultimus getting his hands on it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_INTRO_3,I'll put together a team right away.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_INTRO_4,"Mr. Rand, analysis has revealed the signal to be of a mystic origin. Help us decipher it if you can."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_INTRO_5,It's time we put an end to Ultimus once and for all. I will not fail.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_START_0,We must get to the beacon before Ultimus's forces can find it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_START_1,Too late. We need to intercept this squad and take them down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_END_0,I can sense that my fist can open this. But I will need time to prepare the ritual.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_1_END_1,Let's get this back to the Helicarrier straight away.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_0,Are you sure you know what you're doing?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_1,"Nope! Ok, here goes nothing..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_2,"By the power of the iron fist, I compell you to open..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_3," --KATHOOM--"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_4,--
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_5,"Yeah, so why are there five of you standing in front of us?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_6,We are members of the Strange Society.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_7,Of course you are.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_8,We have arrived to this time and dimension as now is the opportune time to seal Ultimus away in the Nexus of all Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_9,"Well, it'll have to wait as we're still waiting on you and Mordo to show up with the 5 objects of power."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_10,"Ugh, why do I know this..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_INTRO_11,"Ms. Jones, now is not the time to lose focus. Ultimus has begun an attack on the Helicarrier."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_START_0,Listen up Stranges. Stay back while we beat the crap of these guys. We've got this.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_FAIL_0,They took out all the Strange Society. Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_2_END_0,More of Ultimus's forces are incoming. Get ready.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_3_INTRO_0,"T'Challa, if you can hold them off, we can focus on finding Ultimus's current whereabouts."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_3_INTRO_1,Do what you must. We will fight them back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_3_START_0,Ultimus cannot be stopped. Prepare yourselves for oblivion!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_3_END_0,"We have located Ultimus, but the situation is a bit tricky..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INTRO_0,"Alrightly Doctors Strange, lay it on us. No need to dumb it down for us."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INTRO_1,Ultimus is currently under the protection of a mystical barrier that a corrupted Iron Fist has constructed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INTRO_2,It defies all time and space and is unbreakable without knowing the specific ritual that was used.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INTRO_3,"Ok, sounds easy enough. We just need to find this corrupted Iron Fist and learn his ritual."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INTRO_4,"It's a bit more...complicated than that, but yes."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INTRO_5,"I'm sure it is. That's why you're the experts on multidimensional time and space hibbajabba. Let's mosey, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_START_0,"If they get a message out to their Iron Fist, he will escape before we can get to him."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_START_1,Shouldn't be a problem. Taking out enemy operators happens to be a specialty of mine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INFO_1_0,Time to take down those operators. No time like the present.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INFO_2_0,"Come on team, focus on their operators."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INFO_3_0,We're running out of time. Take the operators out!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_FAIL_0,They got their message off to Iron Fist. He's in the wind now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_4_END_0,"Tony, good work. Their Iron Fist won't be expecting us."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_INTRO_0,"Gamora, we could use your expertise here. How about you clear a path for us?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_INTRO_1,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_INTRO_2,"Believe me, the pleasure is all mine."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_START_0,"Hand and Hydra forces on patrol, should be easy enough."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_START_1,"If we move quickly, they won't even see us coming."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_END_0,Area is secured. The corrupted Iron Fist is up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_5_END_1,One step closer to opening Ultimus's impervious barrier.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_6_INTRO_0,Any special strategies we need to use when dealing with this Iron Fist?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_6_INTRO_1,This Iron Fist is exceptionally powerful. Avoid the fury of his fist at all costs.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_6_START_0,It will be an honor to present what's left of your corpses to Ultimus as tribute.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_6_END_0,This Iron Fist was no match for us. Now we shall extract what we need from him.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_0,It looks like we came back at just the right time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_1,Indeed. We have all 5 objects of power and are prepared to do what must be done.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_2,Welcome Doctor. We are the Strange Society and we have come to help seal Ultimus away in the Nexus of All Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_3,Excellent. Your power combined with our will make this ritual possible.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_4,My sources have confirmed Ultimus is on the move.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_5,He's headed for the apex site to open the door to the Nexus from this side.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_6,We'll cover you while we make our way to the ritual site.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_7,"Destroyer of Worlds, as long as we can open the door from the other side with they keys you have obtained, this should work."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_INTRO_8,You can count on us.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_START_0,Ultimus has forces blocking the path to the ritual site.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_START_1,Time to make them wish they weren't on this rock.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_FAIL_0,The Doctor Stranges are down!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_7_END_0,We're clear. No time to waste. We must begin our ritual now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INTRO_0,We must open the portal to the Nexus of All Realities. We are out of time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INTRO_1,We'll cover you. Get it done.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_START_0,Ultimus will throw everything he's got at you. We must concentrate to make this succeed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_START_1,"We've got this. Focus on the ritual, we'll take them down."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INFO_1_0,All 5 objects of power are in place.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INFO_2_0,Beginning the ritual.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INFO_3_0,Making the connection to the Nexus of All Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_FAIL_0,We've lost The Strange Society. We've failed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_8_END_0,The Gateway is open!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_INTRO_0,Something is off. I don't think our plan is going to work.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_INTRO_1,"Wait, how so?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_INTRO_2,"Ultimus is not going through his gateway. If we can't coax him through, this will not work."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_INTRO_3,Not a problem friends!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_INTRO_4,I have arrived once again in your time of need. Allow Thor the God King to help him through the gate.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_START_0,So you planned to trap me inside the Nexus of All Realities?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_START_1,A bold plan. But ill conceived. I will defeat you here and now before stepping through to my paradise.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_START_2,"Actually, it will be your tomb once we've crushed you and thrown your battered body inside. Be prepared."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_START_3,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ULTIMUS</color> TO SAVE THE MULTIVERSE ONCE AND FOR ALL!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_0,Any last words?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_1,You think you have defeated me...but this will not be the last you'll see of me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_2,"Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Enjoy your time spent forever in oblivion."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_3,Don't let the portal hit your ass on the way out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_4,NO!!! YOU CANNOT SO EASILY--
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_5," --KATHOOM--"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_6,--
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_7,"Well, that's done with."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_8,I suppose you want S.H.I.E.L.D. back now?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_9,"Tony, you've know, you've done some excellent work with S.H.I.E.L.D. in my absence."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_10,"Thanks to you and the team, we managed to roll a perfect S.T.R.I.K.E., wouldn't you say?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_9_9_END_11,Nice.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_INTRO_0,Just got word that Ultimus has a bunch of his Kree cronies near one of those interdimensional portals.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_INTRO_1,Wanna go mess 'em up with me?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_INTRO_2,Never met a Kree I didn't end up having to stab anyway. Count me in.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_INTRO_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_INTRO_4,"Yeah, you're right, it probably is a trap. But we gotta do this. Can't risk Ultimus having a portal."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_START_0,"This portal belongs to Ultimus, our one true master. Surrender or we will put you down."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_START_1,"Go ahead, bub. Try me."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_MID_0,You dare challenge the will of Ultimus? Your judgement is now at hand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_ULT_0,"You have put up a worthy fight, but your efforts will end here and now. \nSubmit to my will or be destroyed..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_ULT_1,Everything with you is SO melodramatic. Let's see how tough you are after THIS!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_CAP_0,Looks like you guys could use a little support. Allow me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_X_X_DEMO_END_0,"Thanks for the assist, Avengers. Ultimus won't be using this portal anytime soon."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_0,"What do you want, Kree hunter? The Kree Empire has pledged its loyalty to Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_1,We are now sworn enemies in this war.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_2,"I come in peace, Asgardian. I am part of a resistance movement within the Kree."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_3,Ultimus promised that the Kree would rule our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_4,"He did not mention it would be ruled under his iron fist. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_5,"Ultimus is mad with power. His first act as ruler was to destroy the Supreme Intelligence. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_6,Ronan the Accuser led a Kree rebellion until he was captured.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_7,"If we can free Ronan from Ultimus's prison before he is corrupted, the Kree Resistance will join with S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_8,The Kree could be a valuable ally in the war. We will help you free Ronan.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_START_0,These corrupted will not stand between us and our goal.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_END_0,Ronan is being held near here. We must move quickly.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_INTRO_0,Ultimus is keeping Ronan on this planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_INTRO_1,An army of heathen Ravagers guards the area. Be wary.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_INTRO_2,We will strike them down where they stand.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_START_0,"Ravagers, fresh meat. Take 'em out."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_FAIL_0,They've taken out our allies. We must fall back.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_END_0,Now we just need to find out where Ronan is being held.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INTRO_0,"Ronan could be anywhere on this planet. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INTRO_1,My Kree tracker can pinpoint his location given enough time.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INTRO_2,Then time she shall have.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_START_0,"I can pinpoint Ronan's location with this device. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_1_0,Setting search parameters for Ronan.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_2_0,Triangulating Ronan's location to within 3 kilometers.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_3_0,Location now within a 500 meter radius.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_FAIL_0,They've defeated our operator. Let's regroup.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_END_0,Ronan is being converted on a docked Kree Warship up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_INTRO_0,This warship is where Ronan is being held.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_INTRO_1,We must make haste and dispatch with the guards quickly.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_START_0,There's no way you're taking Ronan back from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_END_0,The Conversion Engine is just up ahead. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INTRO_0,Ronan is already in the conversion chamber. We must hurry.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INTRO_1,We will free your ally. Fear not.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_START_0,"So Korath found us already, huh? That guy is such a pain in the tail! Well, let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_1_0,They are starting the conversion process on Ronan.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_2_0,We must stop their operators before it is too late.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_3_0,We are running out of time. Stop the operators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_FAIL_0,We're too late. Ronan is lost to us.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_0,You were wise to come to my aid. Kree vengeance will be swift.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_1,We must gain access to the Supreme Intelligence. It will help us overthrow Ultimus and--
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_2,Ultimus has destroyed the Supreme Intelligence. You are the only free leader of the Kree left.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_3,"Then we must gather our forces quickly. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_INTRO_0,Ultimus will pay for subverting the Kree Empire.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_INTRO_1,I will purge the galaxy of this false idol and scatter his ashes to the solar winds.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_INTRO_2,THIS is why you are destined to be the next leader of the Kree Resistance.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_START_0,You have taken what belongs to Ultimus. Submit or die.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_END_0,Now we must find a way off this accursed planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_0,"My people will rally to my call. Ultimus must face judgment. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_1,"They need only learn the truth, and they will rise up in arms."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_2,This planet is home to a long-range communications transmitter.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_3,"Take the transmitter, and I will send the word of truth to every corner of the empire."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_4,It appears our plan must wait. I sense a growing storm on the horizon.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_5,"Ultimus has sent the Thors and Hulks of conquered dimensions to stop us. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_START_0,"You are not true Sons of Odin. You have betrayed Asgard, and you shall pay."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_0,The transmitter lies ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_1,"Crush these heretics, and I will broadcast the message to my people. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_2,"We will get you inside. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_3,But be prepared for a fight.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_4,Ultimus has sent corrupted versions of you to stop us.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_START_0,You all stand accused of defying Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_START_1,And are all found GUILTY!
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_0,"We cannot hold back Ultimus's forces for long. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_1,"Ronan, send your message."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_2,We must align the array.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_3,Defend my operator while the signal is sent.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_START_0,Filthy Kree. It is my destiny to destroy you in Ultimus's name.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_START_1,Defend me while I broadcast Ronan's message.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_1_0,Starting up the signal enhancement generators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_2_0,Tracking down all Kree broadcast towers.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_3_0,Opening all Kree broadcast channels.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_FAIL_0,They've defeated our operator. We have failed.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_0,The message is sent. A call to arms to rise up against Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_1,The Kree Resistance will join S.T.R.I.K.E. in your war against this usurper.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_2,"With the liberated Kree at our side, we might turn the tide of this battle."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_3,"True. We have just ignited a Kree civil war. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_4,Peace will not come until all Kree are united as one.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_5,And that cannot happen until Ultimus falls.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_0,"Lo, Star-Lord. We must speak."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_1,We have located Ultimus's energy station that powers his massive portals.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_2,"It is on the planet Contraxia. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_3,"Contraxia? That ice ball is full of outlaws, Ravagers, and mercenaries."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_4,My kind of people.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_5,Which is why the Commander wishes us to lead a cosmic S.T.R.I.K.E. team to the planet...
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_6,And destroy the energy station.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_7,"Thor, you had me at ""lo."""
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_START_0,Ravagers. Shocker. Let's light it up!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_END_0,The energy fortress should be up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_0,"Drax, we have to take out this patrol before they alert the entire base."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_1,Keep everything on the down-low.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_2,I do not keep anything DOWN or LOW. But I will swiftly vanquish these enemies.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_3,Why do I even bother?
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_START_0,"We must take out their operators, or they will alert the entire fortress."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_1_0,They're alerting the fortress.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_2_0,We need to stop their operators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_3_0,We are running out of time. Stop their operators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_FAIL_0,It's too late. We must retreat.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_END_0,Onward into the fortress.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_0,Defeating these guards is the only way to get into the station and destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_1,"Thank you, Captain Obvious."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_2,"You are welcome, Peter Quill."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_3,"But I am Drax, not Obvious. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_4,And I am not a captain.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_START_0,For Asgard!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_END_0,The energy station control room is up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_INTRO_0,Combing through the systems here. It looks like Ultimus has a Scientist Supreme running the show.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_INTRO_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_INTRO_2,Totally. I would NOT want to be on her bad side.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_START_0,You fools. Did you not think I had calculated every possible way you might attempt to stop me?
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_START_1,"Your calculations are no match for my Hammer, Scientist. Step aside, or feel my wrath."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_END_0,We must press on deeper into the fortress.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_INTRO_0,It appears that Scientist Supreme has deployed Ultrons to stop us.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_INTRO_1,These soulless automatons are no match for my blades.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_INTRO_2,"Well put, Drax the Destroyer. Attack!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_START_0,Uh... that's a lot of robots...
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_END_0,We must find access to the control room to destroy the weapon.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_0,This corrupted Yondu holds the security key that will give us access to the engineering control room.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_1,Yondu loves me. Let me handle this.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_2,"Peter, every corrupted version of Yondu we encounter tries to kill you."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_3,But only out of LOVE.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_START_0,"Big mistake showing up here, kid. I'm afraid we're going to have to kill y'all."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_START_1,"See, Gamora. He loves me!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>YONDU</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_END_0,Yondu is vanquished. Grab his key and press onward.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_0,You guys need to cover me while I set the explosives to blow this place sky high.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_1,We do not need to destroy this place to the sky. Only destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_2,"Just cover me, Drax."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_3,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_4,"Yeah, Groot. Maybe his mom DID drop him on his head as a baby."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_START_0,"Cover me, guys. I need all the time you can give me!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_1_0,Gaining access to the base's reactors.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_2_0,Planting the worm to take control of the reactors.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_3_0,Disabling all failsafe controls on the reactors.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_FAIL_0,I AM GROOT!!!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_END_0,We're all set. Time to get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_0,We must make haste and flee before the fortress explodes.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_1,"Let's go, people. You snooze, you lose."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_2,I do not intend to sleep nor admit defeat at a time like this.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_3,"Just run, Drax. Just. Run."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_START_0,Stop them! Don't let them out of here alive!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_END_0,"As expected, I did not sleep, and so I was victorious!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_INTRO_0,We must hurry. The fortress is about to explode.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_INTRO_1,"We're almost clear! Well, except for that massive force standing right in the path of our ship."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_START_0,You will never make it off this planet alive.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_0,Destroying Ultimus's energy station prevents him from transporting more troops into this dimension.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_1,Glad to help out.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_2,Now we must rally the Kree Resistance and take back their home planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_3,Oh yeah. Forgot about that.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_4,"Could we, like, do that tomorrow? This hero stuff is pretty exhausting."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_5,"There is no time to spare, Star-Lord. Every second we waste, Ultimus grows stronger."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_6,Fine. Better get to it then. But you owe me a drink when this is all done.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_7,"If we survive, we shall share a drink of the finest Asgardian ale."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_8,Now you're talking. Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_0,"Loki, you know I would not come to you unless the situation was dire."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_1,"Flattery will get you nowhere, brother."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_2,"We need your help infiltrating Hala, the Kree home world, and overthrowing Ultimus's forces there."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_3,Why me?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_4,"The task requires deception, stealth, and trickery. I know of no one better than you at these things. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_5,"You're going to make me blush. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_6,I'm in.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_7,"Really? Because I had prepared a grand speech about loyalty and ""doing the right thing"" and--"
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_8,"For you to be indebted to me is reward enough. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_9,Follow me. I think I know a way for us to enter the planet undetected.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_START_0,"If we take out the guards of this warship, I can disguise us as the crew."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_START_1,It should get us onto the Kree planet undetected.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_END_0,Getting aboard is the easy part. Making it to Hala without being discovered is another matter.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_0,Convincing the Kree to rebel against Ultimus will not be easy.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_1,We have Ronan the Accuser leading the rebellion. He is well-respected among the Kree.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_2,Would be far easier for me to masquerade as their leader and lead the rebellion.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_3,Let's worry about clearing out this section of the warship first. Global conquest through deception second.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_START_0,You will ALL become children of Ultimus soon.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_END_0,"The Kree home world approaches. If we secure the bridge of the ship, we should arrive safely."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_0,It seems Ultimus put a corrupted Spider-Man in charge of this ship.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_1,"Take him out, and I can appear as him to take control of the ship."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_2,Very well. Let's get this unsavory business over with.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_3,"I'm actually quite enjoying this. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_START_0,Ultimus put me in charge of this ship. No way I'm handing it over to you guys.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_START_1,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>SPIDER-MAN</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_END_0,Now I simply don Spider-Man's likeness and...
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_END_1,...we land on the planet safely under Ultimus's flag.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_END_2,And none too soon. This deception makes my skin crawl.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_0,Ultimus has gathered the Kree who have rebelled against him in an internment camp.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_1,"If we free them before they are converted, the revolution will spill out into the streets of the capital."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_2,"Sowing chaos and confusion? You're starting to think like me, brother."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_3,I like it!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_START_0,We must quickly take out the patrol guarding the internment camp.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_END_0,Easy work. Now to release the prisoners.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_0,The raccoon can access the security gates and release the prisoners remotely.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_1,"Only if you say ""please."""
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_2,And you let me wear your helmet when this is done.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_3,"What? No. Just do your job, vermin."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_4,Worth a shot.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_START_0,We must protect Rocket while he disables the prison security grid.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_1_0,Gaining access to security controls through back door channels.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_2_0,Replacing all security camera footage with empty loop footage.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_3_0,Disabling backup generators for security lockdown procedures.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_FAIL_0,They've taken out Rocket. Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_END_0,Job's done! Now gimme that helmet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_END_1,No. And kindly release my leg.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_0,Now this is interesting. The director of this facility is none other than a corrupted version of myself!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_1,Blessed Odin! Does that mean I get to beat you up while you watch?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_2,"It's always been a dream of mine. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_3,Yes. There's that. But more importantly--
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_4,"After we replace him, I can use my DNA access to disable the planetary defense grid."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_5,Ronan's invasion force can land on the planet undetected.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_START_0,Should have known that S.T.R.I.K.E. would send ME to try to usurp me.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_START_1,We are the most natural choice.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>LOKI</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_0,That was glorious.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_1,I agree. Seeing Ronan's invasion fleet take the capital was impressive.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_2,I was speaking about the part where a corrupted version of you was pummeled into submission.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_3,Yes. That was particularly disturbing.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_4,"Glorious. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_0,"We have driven Ultimus's forces out of the capital. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_1,Now we must press the attack and drive the corrupted off the planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_2,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_3,"We are indebted to you, Loki. But there is still a war to be won."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_4,Of course. But still...
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_5,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_START_0,Ultimus is launching a counterattack with his Ultron forces.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_END_0,Drive them back. Soon they will have no choice but to flee the planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_INTRO_0,Ultimus's forces have fallen back to one last outpost.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_INTRO_1,"We win this next fight, and Hala is ours."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_INTRO_2,"Then let us make haste. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_START_0,DEFENSE MODE INITIATED.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_0,The Kree home world is ours. Ultimus's forces have abandoned the planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_1,"Uh, guys? I'm picking up dark matter signatures coming from an outpost in the north."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_2,I thought we took out all of Ultimus's forces.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_3,"Guess we missed some. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_4,"If they detonate a dark matter bomb, it will take out the entire planet."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_5,Then what are we doing standing around here for?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_START_0,We must stop the operators before they detonate the bomb.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_1_0,We must hurry. They are arming the charges.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_2_0,There is no time to waste!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_3_0,They are nearly finished!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_FAIL_0,The charges have been activated. They are about to detonate the--
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_0,The Kree Resistance control Hala once more. Safe from Ultimus the Usurper.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_1,"And once again, you're welcome."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_2,"Now we must find a way to drive Ultimus out of this dimension entirely. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_3,And THEN we party?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_4,"Aye, Star-Lord. Then the revels commence."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_0,"Fury, I've discovered the true reason Ultimus needs our dimension so badly."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_1,Ours is the closest to a mystical plane known as--
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_2,"The Nexus of All Realities. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_3,"Once Ultimus gains access to it, he can conquer any dimension he chooses."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_4,He needs five ancient artifacts to unlock the path to the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_5,So we stop him from getting those artifacts.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_6,"Too late. He already has them. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_7,"Ultimus has the keys, but he hasn't found the door yet."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_8,The entrance to the Nexus of All Realities is somewhere on Earth.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_9,I'm still waiting for the good news.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_10,"I know a way to travel between dimensions without using Ultimus's portals. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_11,I can take a team of mystics to acquire versions of the artifacts from dimensions Ultimus has yet to invade.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_12,We might be able to get to the Nexus before Ultimus and prevent him from entering.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_13,"Do what you have to, Strange. We have to stop Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_START_0,"The first artifact we need is known as the Ka Stone. I found a dimension where it exists. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_START_1,"Unfortunately, the dimension is ruled by the God of Deception, Loki."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_START_2,You trespass on the Trickster God's domain. Be prepared to feel Loki's wrath.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_END_0,We must fight our way to safety and then locate the Ka Stone.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INTRO_0,Protect me while I search the astral plane for the location of the Ka Stone.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INTRO_1,This sort of power should never have fallen into the hands of a miscreant like Loki.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INTRO_2,"All the more reason for us to take it from him. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_START_0,You dare defile our Loki's sacred space. You will pay in blood.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_1_0,Beginning my search throughout this realm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_2_0,Location coming into focus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_3_0,I've almost got it. Hang on.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_FAIL_0,We cannot proceed without Strange. We must retreat.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_END_0,I have found the Ka Stone. Loki's palace is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_INTRO_0,"Loki will have the Ka Stone in his possession. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_INTRO_1,"Once we retrieve the Stone, we should use it to wipe out this entire dimension."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_INTRO_2,We take the Ka Stone and leave. We have disrupted the natural order of this dimension too much already.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_START_0,What do we have here?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_START_1,Rogues trying to steal my Ka Stone? \nI think not.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_END_0,"We have the Ka Stone. I will guide us to our next destination. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_0,"Prepare yourselves. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_1,"This next dimension is a lawless wasteland. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_2,The land is divided between the warlords Kingpin and Nobu.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_3,Which one has the Wand of Watoomb?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_4,We don't know for certain. Where would you prefer to begin?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_5,Beating up the Hand or beating up Kingpin?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_6,"That's like choosing between candy and chocolate. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_7,"We'll start with Fisk. If he doesn't have it, you'll get your chance to defeat Nobu. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_START_0,This is the Kingpin's territory. Trespassers are shot on sight.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_END_0,"Kingpin's stronghold should be up ahead. Hopefully he possesses the Wand. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INTRO_0,Kingpin is a natural born warlord. He will be well-protected.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INTRO_1,Who wants to bet the Wand of Watoomb is the key to his power?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_START_0,We have to act fast before they call for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_START_1,Kingpin pays triple for people with capes! Tag 'em and bag 'em.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_1_0,Take them down before they call in support!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_2_0,Hurry! They're calling for backup!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_3_0,It's now or never!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_FAIL_0,We're trapped! They've got us surrounded!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_END_0,Kingpin's penthouse is up ahead. Let's go pay him a visit.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_INTRO_0,"Warlord Kingpin, huh? This should be interesting."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_INTRO_1,He'll be more lethal than the Kingpin on our Earth. The Wand of Watoomb is exceptionally powerful.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_INTRO_2,We must keep our focus on him if we have any hope of defeating him and taking the object for ourselves.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_START_0,"Impressive that you made it this far. Unfortunately, this is the end of the road for you."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_START_1,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>KINGPIN</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_END_0,I have secured the Wand of Watoomb. On to the next dimension.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_0,"The next artifact is the ancient tome, the Darkhold."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_1,"That is quite dangerous. In the wrong hands, the Darkhold could wreak havoc."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_2,You have my support in seeking it out.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_3,"Thank you, T'Challa. I know where the Darkhold is, but..."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_4,"What is it, doctor? "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_5,It's in a dimension ruled by an evil Baron Mordo.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_6,"We have faced off several times, but this Mordo will be more powerful with the Darkhold."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_7,Fear not. Together we will best him and take back the Darkhold.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_START_0,"Sorcery is forbidden without express consent from our supreme leader, Baron Mordo. Surrender or die."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_END_0,I've always found this dimension to be particularly oppressive. That's the handywork of Mordo for you.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INTRO_0,"In order to get anywhere near Mordo in this world, we have to first get past his elite bodyguards."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INTRO_1,They call themselves the Sisterhood. All women of exceptional fighting prowess.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_START_0,We must take out their operators before they seal off Mordo's throne room. Let's make this quick.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_START_1,You guys picked the wrong crew to mess with.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_1_0,The barrier ritual has begun.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_2_0,The ritual is growing in strength. Hurry up!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_3_0,They've almost got the barrier up!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_FAIL_0,They completed the spell. There's no way to reach Mordo now.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_END_0,Now only Mordo remains.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_0,Mordo is up ahead. Proceed with caution.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_1,He has the Darkhold in his possession. Expect a tough fight.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_2,I welcome the challenge.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_3,"If we take out Mordo, his power over the others will wane. Defeating him is the key."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_0,"Strange, you should not have come."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_1,"Just hand over the Darkhold and my stay will be extremely short, I assure you."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_2,<color=#fff568>BARON MORDO</color> HEALS AFTER EACH DEATH.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_3,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>BARON MORDO</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_0,We have acquired three of the five objects of power.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_1,Now we need to secure the Warlock's Eye and the Siege Perilous to open the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_2,I found a version of the Siege Perilous in a dimension that has been overrun by Hydra.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_3,An entire dimension ruled by Hydra? Sounds pleasant.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_0,The next mystical item we need to open the Nexus is the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_1,The closest dimension where it exists is ruled by Hydra.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_2,I'll lead a team of mystics to that dimension to retrieve the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_3,An entire dimension ruled by Hydra? Sounds like my worst nightmare.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_4,Worse than an interdimensional invasion of corrupted versions of ourselves?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_5,You making me choose?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_START_0,We have him cornered. Hail Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_START_1,"This dimension's Hawkeye needs our help. And we could use a guide. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAWKEYE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_FAIL_0,Hawkeye is down!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_END_0,Thanks for the assist. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance is in your debt.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_0,"Hawkeye, I don't have time for lengthy exposition. Here's the situation:"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_1,We come from an alternate dimension. We're here to steal the Siege Perilous from Hydra. Can you help us?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_2,"Uh, nice to meet you, too."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_3,"That artifact you mentioned, the Siege Perilous, is the source of Red Skull's power in our world. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_4,"If you can get it from them, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance will have a shot at overthrowing Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_5,"Help me get past the Hydra patrols and back to our base, and I'll help you with your mission."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_6,Just lead the way.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_START_0,We can't get around this patrol. Gotta put them down to move along.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAWKEYE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_FAIL_0,Hawkeye is down! Now we'll never find the Resistance HQ.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_END_0,You guys have a knack for taking down Hydra. Nicely done.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_0,Do you guys have Hydra in your dimension?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_1,"Unfortunately, yes. ""If a head is cut off, two more shall take its place."""
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_2,I take it they don't rule your planet like they do here?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_3,"Not so much. But we've got our own problems. An unstoppable, multi-dimensional alien army recently invaded us."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_4,"Frankly, that sounds like a lot more fun than what's going on here."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_START_0,"Hawkeye, nice to run into you here. Red Skull will be pleased to finally have your head."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_START_1,"If we take out Crossbones first, his platoon will scatter."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAWKEYE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>CROSSBONES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_FAIL_0,They took out Hawkeye! We have no way to find the Resistance HQ now.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_END_0,"Hawkeye, welcome back to HQ. Looks like you found some new friends along the way?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_0,"Director, this group saved my skin out there. We owe them. They come from another dimension and need our help."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_1,"The S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance is on its last leg. If we don't take down Red Skull soon, we'll never free the world from Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_2,"Perhaps we can help. We need to take the Siege Perilous from Red Skull. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_3,"We've been trying to get that artifact from Red Head for years. If you manage that, we could turn the tide."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_4,Director! Hydra troops have breached the perimeter! They've found us!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_START_0,"Natasha, you've been working for Hydra all along? How could you?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_START_1,Give up now. You cannot defeat Red Skull. Hydra is far too powerful.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_START_2,We have to take out the Hydra Operators before they can call in air support!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_1_0,They're calling for air support.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_2_0,We have to stop them!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_3_0,We're running out of time. Take out the operators!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_FAIL_0,We're finished. Their bombers will be here any minute!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_END_0,We need to bring the fight directly to Red Skull. I've got an idea...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_0,"Director Quake, what's the plan?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_1,There's a Hydra lab nearby that I hacked into. Red Skull's spymaster is scheduled to be there today.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_2,"If we can get inside and corner him, we can grab his access codes and use them to get into Red Skull's bunker."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_3,That lab has a bunch of civilian scientists working there. We need to protect them if we get into a firefight.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_4,"Good call, Hawkeye."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_START_0,"Remember, we need to protect the civilians at all costs."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_START_1,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>CIVILIANS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_FAIL_0,They took out the civilians!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_END_0,Red Skull's spymaster is in the lab up ahead. Let's move!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_0,So who is this mysterious spymaster of Red Skull?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_1,"Well, he used to run S.H.I.E.L.D., but it turned out he was part of Hydra all along."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_2,You can't mean--
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_3,Nick Fury.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_4,Oh. I thought you were going to say someone else.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_5,"So you have Fury in your dimension, too? Is he a manipulative and deceptive mastermind or a good guy?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_6,Yes. And yes.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_START_0,"Quake, surrender now before your people get hurt."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_START_1,"Fat chance, Fury. You betrayed your people and the cause. Today, we're putting you down for good."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>NICK FURY</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_END_0,Fury's down. I've got the access codes. Let's get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INTRO_0,"Captain, the Skull's Nest is just up ahead. Based on the blueprints, we can gain access here."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INTRO_1,"Good work, Hawkeye. We need to take out any Hydra patrols we encounter to avoid sounding the alarm."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_START_0,Hydra Operators are part of this patrol. Take them out quickly to avoid the alarm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_1_0,They're calling for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_2_0,If they sound the alarm we're done for.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_3_0,We can't let them sound the alarm!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_FAIL_0,We're too late. No way to Red Skull now. The fortress is on lockdown.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_END_0,Area is secured. Let's keep moving.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_INTRO_0,Slight change of plans. I'm picking up chatter that Hydra has S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance fighters up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_INTRO_1,"If we can free them from their cells and get them into the fight, it'll increase our odds."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_INTRO_2,Sounds reasonable. We'll provide the cover you need.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_START_0,We need to free these S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoners.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_START_1,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>S.H.I.E.L.D. RESISTANCE PRISONERS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_FAIL_0,Our resistance fighters have been taken out. Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_END_0,Red Skull's subterreanean bunker is up ahead. Time to end this.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_INTRO_0,"If we defeat Red Skull, you can have the Siege Perilous for your world."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_INTRO_1,"Thank you, Captain. We won't let you down."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_START_0,"You cannot hope to defeat me. Hydra has, and will always, rule this world."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_START_1,Hail Hydra!!!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>RED SKULL</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_0,"With Red Skull gone, Hydra has lost its leader. Now we need to capitalize on the momentum."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_1,"We are forever in your debt. When you need us, we'll come to your aid."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_2,Glad to help.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_3,And here is the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_4,"What do you need this thing for, anyway?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_5,"It's a key. A key that opens a magical gate to another dimension, and maybe to victory."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_6,Good luck retaking the world. And keep an eye out for any interdimensional alien invaders.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_7,What was that about?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_0,I've located a dimension with the final artifact we need to open the portal to the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_1,You found the Warlock's Eye? We must go there immediately.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_2,And lay waste to any who stand in our way.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_3,"Not so fast, Mordo. This dimension is ruled by a benevolent God of Thunder, Thor."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_4,I don't care if it's ruled by the God of Adorable Puppies.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_5,"If it stands in the way of our goal, we must eliminate it."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_6,"If we treat every obstacle as a threat, we make enemies out of everyone. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_7,"We have to be better than that. We will negotiate with this God King Thor. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_8,Perhaps we can even make an ally out of him in our war.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_START_0,"Halt! If you seek an audience with the God King, Thor Odinson, you must prove yourselves worthy."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_START_1,In combat.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_END_0,You have shown great spirit. Come! Let us speak...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_0,"Good King Thor, we are travelers from another dimension. We need to ""borrow"" an artifact, the Warlock's Eye, to stop a threat to our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_1,"The Warlock's Eye? I cannot simply ""lend"" items of power to strangers from another land."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_2,Would it make any difference if I told you that this threat will eventually wipe out your dimension if we do not stop it in ours?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_3,"Possibly. You seem noble in your cause and manner. I will grant you your wish, wizard. On one condition..."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_4,"You must complete the Three Trials of Asgard. If you do, I will grant you the Warlock's Eye."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_5,Trials? Really? Fine. Let's get this over with.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_6,"I like your confidence, sorcerer. Let the Trials begin!"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_START_0,First you must best my Captain of the Guard in the Trial of Strength.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_START_1,Welcome to the Trial of Strength. Get ready to get your butt kicked.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_END_0,The true test begins in the next chamber. Prepare yourselves.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_INTRO_0,The final test in the Trial of Strength stands before you.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_INTRO_1,He is known as the Unbreakable. Nothing will pierce his skin.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_INTRO_2,"Defeat him, and you will move on to the second trial."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_START_0,Bring it on.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_START_1,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>LUKE CAGE</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_END_0,"Most impressive. Though the next trial will prove more difficult, I am sure of it."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_INTRO_0,The second trial will put your team's wits and reflexes to the test.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_INTRO_1,You must defeat my blind Seer: The Daredevil.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_INTRO_2,This should be fun.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_START_0,"I can sense your fear. But don't worry, this will all be over with soon enough."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_0,We have two more trials to get through.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_1,And then King Thor will give us the Warlock's Eye.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_2,I still think we should just take it from him by force.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_3,"That way only makes enemies, not allies. And we need all the allies we can get."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_4,Very well. Bring on the next challenge.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_START_0,Catch me if you can.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_END_0,The final test of this trial lies ahead. Good luck. You will need it.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_INTRO_0,Who do you have in store for us now?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_INTRO_1,"Why none other than my brother, Loki himself!"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_INTRO_2,"He is a master of trickery. If you defeat him, you will be worthy of the third trial."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_START_0,"This sort of thing bores me. Let's get it over with, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_START_1,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>LOKI</color> TO WIN THIS MISSION.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_END_0,Hah! Seeing Loki be defeated gets me EVERY time. On to the final trial you go.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_INTRO_0,The third trial begins with a test against the best headhunters from across the entire realm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_INTRO_1,Defeat them to proceed.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_START_0,"I suggested a dance-off, but King Thor says this has to be a trial by combat."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_START_1,Oh well...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_INTRO_0,"In order to be worthy of the final test, you must defeat my champions once again... all at once."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_INTRO_1,That sounds... challenging.

ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_START_0,Now let's see how you fare against us at full strength.

ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_INTRO_1,"If you wish me to grant you the Warlock's Eye, you have but one simple task remaining."

ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_2,"But I must ask, what use have you of this powerful artifact?"
