After every match, the characters who participated must recover and cannot be used for a period of time. Use <color=#fff568>BLITZ CHARGES</color> to recover your characters instantly. Earn <color=#fff568>BLITZ CHARGES</color> in <color=#fff568>CHALLENGES</color>, <color=#fff568>MILESTONES</color>, and other parts of the game.

ID_ME_DE_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,Info and Update on How It Works
ID_ME_BO_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,"We'd like to provide some information on how characters are released in MARVEL Strike Force. Generally, a new character makes their debut as the main prize in Blitz mode. At the same time, that hero is made available for purchase in the Featured Character Orb. Once the Blitz ends, the character is added to the Ultimus Orb. After some time, the character is added to the Premium Orb. Finally, the character is added to a campaign node, a store, an orb, etc. This is the usual path for our characters but does not apply to all of them. Characters released through events, such as Deadpool, may be released through other game modes.\n\nBlack Panther, Doctor Strange, and Vision are the first characters to go through this process and have been added to the Ultimus Orb.\n\nThank you for playing MARVEL Strike Force!\n--MARVEL Strike Force Dev Team"
