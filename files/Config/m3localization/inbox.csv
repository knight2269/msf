ID_ME_DE_ARENAUNLOCK,Test your squad (and your wit) against others!
ID_ME_BO_ARENAUNLOCK,"Compete against other Commanders in <color=#fff568>BLITZ</color> to win various milestone rewards. The best prize goes to the Commander with the greatest number of points.\n\nPoints are rewarded for every match you win. Earn more points by beating stronger opponents!

Lose twice in a row and you'll be demoted a tier.\n\nA word of caution: Fighting battles in Blitz is exhausting. After every match, the characters who participated must recover and cannot be used for a period of time. Use <color=#fff568>BLITZ CHARGES</color> to recover your characters instantly. Earn <color=#fff568>BLITZ CHARGES</color> in <color=#fff568>CHALLENGES</color>, <color=#fff568>MILESTONES</color>, and other parts of the game.

ID_ME_NA_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,Character Release Process
ID_ME_DE_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,Info and Update on How It Works
ID_ME_BO_RELEASEULT_BPDSVIS,"We'd like to provide some information on how characters are released in MARVEL Strike Force. Generally, a new character makes their debut as the main prize in Blitz mode. At the same time, that hero is made available for purchase in the Featured Character Orb. Once the Blitz ends, the character is added to the Ultimus Orb. After some time, the character is added to the Premium Orb. Finally, the character is added to a campaign node, a store, an orb, etc. This is the usual path for our characters but does not apply to all of them.
